<h2>AN ESSAY ON ELOCUTION,</h2>

<h3>DESIGNED FOR THE USE OF SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE LEARNERS</h3>

<h2>BY SAMUEL KIRKHAM.</h2>

<p>This work is mainly designed as a Reading-Book for Schools. In the first
part of it, the <i>principles</i> of reading are developed and explained in a
scientific and <i>practical</i> manner, and so familiarly illustrated in
their application to practical examples as to enable even the juvenile
mind very readily to comprehend their nature and character, their design
and use, and thus to acquire that high degree of excellence, both, in
reading and speaking, which all desire, but to which few attain.</p>

<p>The last part of the work, contains <i>Selections</i> from the greatest
master-pieces of rhetorical and poetical composition, both ancient and
modern. Many of these selections are taken from the most elegant and
classical American authors&mdash;writers whose noble productions have already
shed an unfading lustre, and stamped immortality upon the literature of
our country.&mdash;In the select part of the work, <i>rhetorical marks</i> are
also employed to point out the application of the principles laid down
in the first part.&mdash;The very favorable reception of the work by the
public, and its astonishingly rapid introduction into schools, since its
first publication in 1833, excites in the author the most sanguine hopes
in regard to its future success.</p>

<h3>NOTICES.</h3>

<p>After a careful perusal of this work, we are decidedly of opinion, that
it is the only <i>successful</i> attempt of the kind. The rules are copious,
and the author's explanations and illustrations <i>are happily adapted to
the comprehension of learners</i>. No school should be without this book,
and it ought to find a place in the library of every gentleman who
values the attainment of a just and forcible elocution.&mdash;<i>Pittsburgh
Mer. April,</i> 1834.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkham has given rules for inflections and emphasis, and has
followed them by illustrative examples, and these by remarks upon the
inflection which he has adopted, and the reasons for his preference of
one inflection to another&mdash;a most admirable plan for such a work.
Copious examples occur in which all the various inflections and the
shades of emphasis are distinguished with great accuracy and clearness.
The catechetical appendages of each chapter, give the work new value in
a school, and the selections made for the exercise of scholars, evince
good taste and judgment. <i>U.S. Gazette, Philadelphia, Sept</i>. 17, 1834.</p>

<p>The Essay now before us, needs not depend on any former work of its
author for a borrowed reputation; it has intrinsic merits of its own. It
lays down principles clearly and concisely. It presents the reader with
many new and judicious selections, both in prose and poetry; and
altogether evinces great industry combined with taste and
ingenuity.&mdash;<i>Courier of Upper Canada, York, Oct</i>. 12, 1833.</p>

<p>Of the talent and judgment of Mr. Kirkham, we have already had occasion
to speak in terms of honest praise. His work on Elocution raises him
still higher in our estimation.&mdash;The book would be of great utility in
schools&mdash;such a one as has long been wanted; and we are glad to see it
forthcoming.&mdash;<i>Baltimore Visitor, July,</i> 1833.</p>

<p>Every facility for teaching Elocution, which I have so often needed, but
never before found, is exactly furnished in this work:&mdash;principles are
clearly and concisely laid down, and <i>are very happily adapted to the
comprehension of the learner</i>. Thoroughly convinced of its utility, I
shall lose no time in introducing it into my school. <i>Hartford, Conn.

<a name='RECOMMENDATIONS'></a><h2>RECOMMENDATIONS.</h2>

<p>It is well known that the recommendations which generally accompany new
books have very little weight with the public. This is as it should be,
for that work which rests more on its written testimonials, than on its
intrinsic merits for support, asserts no claims to permanent patronage.
But recommendations which analyze the merits of a work, and which, by
exhibiting its prominent features in a striking light, are calculated to
carry conviction to the reader that the system recommended is
meritorious, the author is proud to have it in his power to present in
this volume. The following are <i>some</i> of the numerous testimonials which
he has received, and for which he tenders his grateful acknowledgments
to those literary gentlemen to whose liberality and politeness he is
indebted for them. More than <i>six hundred</i> others presented to the
author, and many of which are equally flattering with these, he has not
room to insert.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following notice of this work is extracted from the &quot;Western
Review.&quot; This journal is ably conducted by the Rev. Timothy Flint,
author of &quot;Francis Berrian,&quot; &quot;History and Geography of the Miss.
Valley,&quot; and many other popular and valuable works.</p>

<p>We had not, at that time, seen Mr. Kirkham's &quot;Grammar in familiar
Lectures,&quot; but have since given it a cursory perusal. If we comprehend
the author's design, it is not so much to introduce new principles, as
to render more easy and intelligible those which have been long
established, and to furnish additional facilities to an accurate and
thorough knowledge of our language. In this we think he has been
successful.</p>

<p>It is to be expected that a modest, unassuming writer, on presenting
himself before the public tribunal as an author, will, as far as is
consistent with his plan, avail himself of the authority of such as have
written well on the subject before him. Mr. Kirkham has accordingly
followed Mr. Murray in the old beaten track of English writers on
grammar, in the general principles of his science; endeavoring, at the
same time, to avoid whatever appeared to be erroneous or absurd in the
writings of that author, and adopting an entirely new arrangement. The
most useful matter contained in the treatise of Mr. Murray, is embraced
in this; but in the definitions and rules, it is simplified, and
rendered much more intelligible. Though our author follows Mr. Murray,
in the general principles of his work, he has, in numerous instances,
differed from him, pursuing a course that appears to be his own, and
introducing some valuable improvements.</p>

<p>Among these may be mentioned some additional rules and explanatory notes
in syntax, the arrangement of the parts of speech, the mode of
explaining them, manner of parsing, manner of explaining some of the
pronouns, and the use of a synopsis which presents the essentials of the
science at one view, and is well calculated to afford assistance to
learners.</p>

<p>In his arrangement of the parts of speech, Mr. Kirkham seems to have
endeavored to follow <i>the order of nature;</i> and we are not able to see
how he could have done better. The noun and verb, as being the most
important parts of speech, are first explained, and afterwards those
which are considered in a secondary and subordinate character. By
following this order, he has avoided the absurdity so common among
authors, of defining the minor parts before their principals, of which
they were designed to be the appendages, and has rationally prepared the
way for conducting the learner by easy advances to a correct view of the
science.</p>

<p>In his illustrations of the various subjects contained in his work, our
author appears to have aimed, not at a flowery style, nor at the
appearance of being learned, but at being understood. The clearness and
perspicuity of his remarks, and their application to familiar objects,
are well calculated to arrest the attention, and aid the understanding
of the pupil, and thereby to lessen the labor of the instructor. The
principles of the science <i>are simplified, and rendered so perfectly
easy of comprehension,</i> we should think no ordinary mind, having such
help, could find them difficult. It is in this particular that the work
appears to possess its chief merit, and on this account it cannot fail
of being preferred to many others.</p>

<p>It gives us pleasure to remark, in reference to the success of the
amiable and modest author whose work is before us, that we quote from
the fifth edition.</p>

<p>The following is from the pen of a gentleman of the Bar, formerly a
distinguished Classical teacher. [Extract from the &quot;National Crisis.&quot;]</p>

<p>As a friend to literature, and especially to genuine merit, it is with
peculiar pleasure I allude to a notice in a late paper of this city, in
which Mr. S. Kirkham proposes to deliver a course of Lectures on English
Grammar. To such as feel interested in acquiring a general and practical
knowledge of this useful science an opportunity is now presented which
ought not to be neglected. Having myself witnessed, in several
instances, within the last ten months, the practical results of Mr.
Kirkham's plan, I am enabled to give a decisive opinion of its merits.
The extensive knowledge acquired in one course by his class in
Pittsburgh, and the great proficiency evinced by his classes elsewhere,
are a demonstration of the utility and superiority of his method of
teaching, and a higher encomium on him than I am able to bestow.</p>

<p>The principles on which Mr. Kirkham's &quot;New system of Grammar&quot; is
predicated, are judiciously compiled, and happily and briefly expressed;
but the great merit of his work consists in the lucid illustrations
accompanying the principles, and the simple and gradual manner in which
it conducts the learner along from step to step through the successive
stages of the science. The explanations blended with the theory, are
addressed to the understanding of the pupil in a manner so familiar,
that they cannot fail to excite in him a deep interest; and whatever
system is calculated to bring into requisition the mental powers, must,
I conceive, be productive of good results. In my humble opinion, the
system of teaching introduced into this work, will enable a diligent
pupil to acquire, without any other aid, a practical knowledge of
grammar, <i>in less than one-fourth</i> part of the time usually devoted.</p>

<p>My views of Mr. Kirkham's system are thus publicly given, with the
greater pleasure, on account of the literary empiricisms which have been
so extensively practised in many parts of the western country.</p>

<p>From Mr. Blood, Principal of the Chambersburgh Academy, Pa.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkham,&mdash;It is now almost twenty years since I became a teacher of
youth, and, during this period, I have not only consulted all, but have
used many of the different systems of English grammar that have fallen
in my way; and, sir, I do assure you, without the least wish to flatter,
that yours far exceeds any I have yet seen.</p>

<p>Your arrangement and systematic order of parsing are most excellent; and
experience has convinced me, (having used it, and it only, for the last
twelve or thirteen months), that a scholar will learn more of the nature
and principles of our language in <i>one quarter</i>, from your system, than
in a <i>whole year</i> from any other I had previously used. I do, therefore,
most cheerfully and earnestly recommend it to the public at large, and
especially to those who, anxious to acquire a knowledge of our language,
are destitute of the advantages of an instructer.</p>

<p>From Mr. N.R. Smith, editor of a valuable literary journal, styled &quot;The
Hesperus.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkham,</p>

<p>Sir, I have examined your Lectures on English Grammar with that degree
of minuteness which enables me to yield my unqualified approbation of
the work as a grammatical system. The engaging manner in which you have
explained the elements of grammar, and accommodated them to the
capacities of youth, is an ample illustration of the utility of your
plan. In addition to this, the critical attention you have paid to an
<i>analytical development</i> of grammatical principles, while it is
calculated to encourage the perseverance of young students in the march
of improvement, is sufficient, also, to employ the researches of the
literary connoisseur. I trust that your valuable compilation will be
speedily introduced into schools and academies.</p>

<p>With respect, yours, N.R. SMITH, A.M.</p>

<p>From Mr. Jungmann, Principal of the Frederick Lutheran
Academy:&mdash;Extract.</p>

<p>Having carefully examined Mr. S. Kirkham's new system of &quot;English
Grammar in familiar Lectures,&quot; I am satisfied that the pre-eminent
advantages it possesses over our common systems, will soon convince the
public, that it is not one of those feeble efforts of quackery which
have so often obtruded upon our notice. Its decided <i>superiority over
all other systems</i>, consists in adapting the subject-matter to the
capacity of the young learner, and the happy mode adopted of
communicating it to his mind in a manner so clear and simple, that he
can easily comprehend the nature and the application of every principle
that comes before him.</p>

<p>In short, all the intricacies of the science are <i>elucidated so
clearly</i>, I am confident that even a private learner, of common
docility, can, by perusing this system attentively acquire a better
practical knowledge of this important branch of literature in <i>three
months</i>, than is ordinarily obtained in <i>one year</i>.</p>

<p>S. Kirkham, Esq.&mdash;I have examined your Grammar with attention, and with
a particular view to benefit the Institution under my charge. I am fully
satisfied, that it is the <i>best form</i> in which Murray's principles have
been given to the public. The lectures are ample, and given in so
familiar and easy language, as to be readily understood, even by a
<i>tyro</i> in grammar.</p>

<p>I feel it due to you to say, that I commenced the examination of your
work, under <i>a strong prejudice against it,</i> in consequence of the
numerous &quot;improved systems&quot; with which the public has been inundated, of
late, most of which are by no means improvements on Murray, but the
productions of individuals whom a &quot;<i>little grammar</i> has rendered
grammatically insane.&quot; My convictions, therefore, are the result of

<p>From A.W. Dodge, Esq.</p>

<p>New-York, July 15, 1829.</p>

<p>The experience of every one at all acquainted with the business of
instruction, must have taught him that the study of grammar, important
as it is to every class of learners, is almost invariably a dry and
uninteresting study to young beginners, and for the very obvious reason,
that the systems in general use in the schools, are <i>far beyond</i> the
comprehension of youth, and ill adapted to their years. Hence it is,
that their lessons in this department of learning, are considered as
<i>tasks,</i> and if committed at all, committed to <i>the memory, without
enlightening their understandings;</i> so that many a pupil who has <i>been
through</i> the English grammar, is totally unacquainted with the nature
even of the simplest parts of speech.</p>

<p>The work of Mr. Kirkham on grammar, is well calculated to remedy these
evils, and supply a deficiency which has been so long and so seriously
felt in the imperfect education of youth in the elementary knowledge of
their own language. By a simple, familiar, and lucid method of treating
the subject, he has rendered what was before irksome and unprofitable,
pleasing and instructive. In one word, the grammar of Mr. Kirkham
furnishes a <i>clew</i> by which the youthful mind is guided through the
intricate labyrinth of verbs, nouns and pronouns; and the path which has
been heretofore so difficult and uninviting, as to dampen the ardor of
youth, and waste their energies in fruitless attempts to surmount its
obstacles, is cleared of these obstructions by this <i>pioneer</i> to the
youthful mind, and planted, at every turn, with friendly <i>guide-boards
to direct them in the right road</i>. The slightest perusal of the work
alluded to, will convince even the most skeptical of the truth of these
remarks, and satisfy every one who is not wedded by prejudice to old
rules and forms, that it will meet the wants of the community.</p>

<p>ALLEN W. DODGE.</p>

<p>Philadelphia, Aug. 10, 1829</p>



<hr style='width: 25%;' />
<p>Having, for several years, been engaged in lecturing on the science of
grammar and, during this period, having <i>thoroughly tested</i> the merits
of Mr. S. Kirkham's system of &quot;English Grammar in Familiar Lectures&quot; by
using it as a text-book for my classes, I take pleasure in giving this
testimonial of my cordial approbation of the work. Mr. Kirkham has
attempted to improve upon this branch of science, chiefly by unfolding
and explaining the principles of grammar in a manner so clear and
simple, as <i>to adapt them completely to the understanding</i> of the young
learner, and by adopting a new arrangement, which enables the pupil to
commit the principles by a simultaneous application of them to practical
examples. The public may rest assured, that he has been successful in
his attempt <i>in a pre-eminent degree</i>. I make this assertion under a
full conviction that it will be corroborated by every candid judge of
the science who becomes acquainted with the practical advantages of this
manual.</p>

<p>The explicit brevity and accuracy of the rules and definitions, the
novel, the striking, the lucid, and critical illustrations accompanying
them, the peculiar and advantageous arrangement of the various parts of
the subject, the facilities proffered by the &quot;systematic mode of
parsing&quot; adopted, the convenient and judicious introduction and
adaptation of the exercises introduced, and the deep researches and
critical investigations displayed in the &quot;Philosophical Notes,&quot; render
this system of grammar <i>so decidedly superior to all others extant</i>,
that, to receive general patronage, it needs but to be known.</p>

<p>My knowledge of this system from experience in teaching it, and
witnessing its effects in the hands of private learners, warrants me in
saying, that a learner will, by studying this book <i>four months without
a teacher</i>, obtain a more clear conception of the nature and proper
construction of words and phrases, than is ordinarily obtained in common
schools and academies, <i>in five times four months</i>.</p>

<p>It is highly gratifying to know, that wherever this system has been
circulated, it is very rapidly supplanting those works of dulness which
have so long paralyzed the energies of the youth of our country.</p>

<p>I think the specimens of verbal criticism, additional corrections in
orthography and ortheopy, the leading principles of rhetoric, and the
improvements in the illustrations generally, which Mr. K. is about
introducing into his ELEVENTH EDITION, will render it quite <i>an
improvement on the former editions of this work</i>. H. WINCHESTER.</p>

<p>From the Rev. S. Center, Principal of a Classical Academy.</p>




<hr style='width: 25%;' />
<p>I have examined the last edition of Kirkham's Grammar with peculiar
satisfaction. The improvements which appear in it, do, in my estimation,
give it a decided preference to any other system now in use. To point
out the peculiar qualities which secure to it claims of which no other
system can boast, would be, if required, perfectly easy. At present it
is sufficient to remark, that it imbodies all that is essentially
excellent and useful in other systems, while it is entirely free from
that tediousness of method and prolixity of definition which so much
perplex and embarrass the learner.</p>

<p>The peculiar excellence of Mr. Kirkham's grammar is, <i>the simplicity of
its method</i>, and <i>the plainness of its illustrations</i>. Being conducted
by familiar lectures, the teacher and pupil are necessarily brought into
agreeable contact by each lesson. Both are improved by the same task,
without the slightest suspicion, on the part of the pupil, that there is
anything hard, difficult, or obscure in the subject: a conviction, this,
which must inevitably precede all efforts, or no proficiency will be
made. In a word, the treatise I am recommending, is a <i>practical</i> one;
and for that reason, if there were no others to be urged, it ought to be
introduced into all our schools and academies. From actual experiment I
can attest to the practicability of the plan which the author has
adopted. Of this fact any one may be convinced who will take the pains
to make the experiment. SAMUEL CENTER.</p>

<p>From a communication addressed to S. Kirkham, by the Rev. J. Stockton,
author of the &quot;Western Calculator&quot; and &quot;Western Spelling-Book.&quot;</p>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I am much pleased with both the <i>plan</i> and <i>execution</i> of
your &quot;English Grammar in Familiar Lectures.&quot; In giving a <i>systematic
mode of parsing</i>, calculated alike to exercise the <i>understanding</i> and
<i>memory</i> of the pupil, and also free the teacher from the <i>drudgery</i> of
continued interrogation, you have made your grammar what every
<i>elementary</i> school book ought to be&mdash;<i>plain, systematic</i>, and <i>easy</i> to
be understood.</p>

<p>This, with the copious definitions in every part of the work, and other
improvements so judiciously introduced, gives it <i>a decisive
superiority</i> over the imperfect grammar of Murray, now so generally
used. JOSEPH STOCKTON, A.M.</p>

<h2>TO THE ELEVENTH EDITION.</h2>

<p>The author is free to acknowledge, that since this treatise first
ventured on the wave of public opinion, the gales of patronage which
have waited it along, have been far more favorable than he had reason to
anticipate. Had any one, on its first appearance, predicted, that the
demand for it would call forth <i>twenty-two thousand</i> copies during the
past year, the author would have considered the prediction extravagant
and chimerical. In gratitude, therefore, to that public which has smiled
so propitiously on his humble efforts to advance the cause of learning,
he has endeavored, by unremitting attention to the improvement of his
work, to render it as useful and as unexceptionable as his time and
talents would permit.</p>

<p>It is believed that the <i>tenth</i> and <i>eleventh</i> editions have been
greatly improved; but the author is apprehensive that his work is not
yet as accurate and as much simplified as it may be. If, however, the
disadvantages of lingering under a broken constitution, and of being
able to devote to this subject only a small portion of his time,
snatched from the active pursuits of a business life, (<i>active</i> as far
as his imperfect health permits him to be,) are any apology for its
defects, he hopes that the candid will set down the apology to his
credit. This personal allusion is hazarded with the additional hope,
that it will ward off some of the arrows of criticism which may be aimed
at him, and render less pointed and poisonous those that may fall upon
him. Not that he would beg a truce with the gentlemen critics and
reviewers. Any compromise with them would betray a want of
self-confidence and moral courage which he would, by no means, be
willing to avow. It would, moreover, be prejudicial to his interest; for
he is determined, if his life be preserved, to avail himself of the
advantages of any judicious and candid criticisms on his production,
that may appear, and, two or three years hence, <i>revise</i> his work, and
present to the public another and a better edition.</p>

<p>The improvements in the <i>tenth</i> edition, consisted mainly in the
addition of many important principles; in rendering the illustrations
more critical, extensive, accurate, and lucid; in connecting more
closely with the genius and philosophy of our language, the general
principles adopted; and in adding a brief view of philosophical grammar
interspersed in notes. The introduction into the ELEVENTH EDITION, of
many verbal criticisms, of additional corrections in orthography and
orthoepy, of the leading principles of rhetoric, and of general
additions and improvements in various parts of the work, render <i>this
edition,</i> it is believed, <i>far preferable</i> to any of the former
editions of the work.</p>

<p>Perhaps some will regard the philosophical notes as a useless exhibition
of pedantry. If so, the author's only apology is, that some
investigations of this nature seemed to be called for by a portion of
the community whose minds, of late, appear to be under the influence of
a kind of <i>philosophical mania;</i> and to such these notes are
respectfully submitted for just what <i>they</i> may deem their real value.
The author's own opinion on this point, is, that they proffer no
<i>material</i> advantages to common learners; but that they may profitably
engage the attention of the curious, and perhaps impart a degree of
interest to the literary connoisseur.</p>

<a name='PREFACE'></a><h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>There appears to be something assuming in the act of writing, and
thrusting into public notice, a new work on a subject which has already
employed many able pens; for who would presume to do this, unless he
believed his production to be, in some respects, superior to every one
of the kind which had preceded it? Hence, in presenting to the public
this system of English Grammar, the author is aware that an apology will
be looked for, and that the arguments on which that apology is grounded,
must inevitably undergo a rigid scrutiny. Apprehensive, however, that no
explanatory effort, on his part, would shield him from the imputation of
arrogance by such as are blinded by self-interest, or by those who are
wedded to the doctrines mid opinions of his predecessors, with <i>them</i> he
will not attempt a compromise, being, in a great measure, indifferent
either to their praise or their censure. But with the candid, he is
willing to negotiate an amicable treaty, knowing that they are always
ready to enter into it on honorable terms. In this negotiation he asks
nothing more than merely to rest the merits of his work on its practical
utility, believing that, if it prove uncommonly successful in
facilitating the progress of youth in the march of mental improvement,
<i>that</i> will be its best apology.</p>

<p>When we bring into consideration the numerous productions of those
learned philologists who have labored so long, and, as many suppose, so
successfully, in establishing the principles of our language; and, more
especially, when we view the labors of some of our modern compilers, who
have displayed so much ingenuity and acuteness in attempting to arrange
those principles in such a manner as to form a correct and an easy
medium of mental conference; it does, indeed, appear a little like
presumption for a young man to enter upon a subject which has so
frequently engaged the attention and talents of men distinguished for
their erudition. The author ventures forward, however, under the
conviction, that most of his predecessors are very deficient, at least,
in <i>manner,</i> if not in <i>matter</i>; and this conviction, he believes, will
be corroborated by a majority of the best judges in community. It is
admitted, that many valuable improvements have been made by some of our
late writers, who have endeavored to simplify and render this subject
intelligible to the young learner, but they have all overlooked what the
author considers a very important object, namely, <i>a systematic order of
parsing;</i> and nearly all have neglected to <i>develop and explain</i> the
principles in such a manner as to enable the learner, without great
difficulty, to comprehend their nature and use.</p>

<p>By some this system will, no doubt, be discarded on account of its
<i>simplicity</i>; while to others its simplicity will prove its principal
recommendation. Its design is an humble one. It proffers no great
advantages to the recondite grammarian; it professes not to instruct the
literary connoisseur; it presents no attractive graces of style to
charm, no daring flights to astonish, no deep researches to gratify
him; but in the humblest simplicity of diction, it attempts to
accelerate the march of the juvenile mind in its advances in the path of
science, by dispersing those clouds that so often bewilder it, and
removing those obstacles that generally retard its progress. In this way
it endeavors to render interesting and delightful a study which has
hitherto been considered tedious, dry, and irksome. Its leading object
is to adopt a correct and an easy method, in which pleasure is blended
with the labors of the learner, and which is calculated to excite in him
a spirit of inquiry, that shall call forth into vigorous and useful
exercise, every latent energy of his mind; and thus enable him soon to
become thoroughly acquainted with the nature of the principles, and with
their practical utility and application.</p>

<p>Content to be useful, instead of being brilliant, the writer of these
pages has endeavored to shun the path of those whose aim appears to have
been to dazzle, rather than to instruct. As he has aimed not so much at
originality as utility, he has adopted the thoughts of his predecessors
whose labors have become public stock, whenever he could not, in his
opinion, furnish better and brighter of his own. Aware that there is, in
the public mind, a strong predilection for the doctrines contained in
Mr. Murray's grammar, he has thought proper, not merely from motives of
policy, but from choice, to select his <i>principles</i> chiefly from that
work; and, moreover, to adopt, as far as consistent with his own views,
the language of that eminent philologist. In no instance has he varied
from him, unless he conceived that, in so doing, some practical
advantage would be gained. He hopes, therefore, to escape the censure so
frequently and so justly awarded to those unfortunate innovators who
have not scrupled to alter, mutilate, and torture the text of that able
writer, merely to gratify an itching propensity to figure in the world
as authors, and gain an ephemeral popularity by arrogating to themselves
the credit due to another.</p>

<p>The author is not disposed, however, to disclaim all pretensions to
originality; for, although his principles are chiefly selected, (and who
would presume to make new ones?) the manner of arranging, illustrating,
and applying them, is principally his own. Let no one, therefore, if he
happen to find in other works, ideas and illustrations similar to <i>some</i>
contained in the following lectures, too hastily accuse him of
plagiarism. It is well known that similar investigations and pursuits
often elicit corresponding ideas in different minds: and hence it is not
uncommon for the same thought to be strictly <i>original</i> with many
writers. The author is not here attempting to manufacture a garment to
shield him from rebuke, should he unjustly claim the property of
another; but he wishes it to be understood, that a long course of
teaching and investigation, has often produced in his mind ideas and
arguments on the subject of grammar, exactly or nearly corresponding
with those which he afterwards found, had, under similar circumstances,
been produced in the minds of others. He hopes, therefore, to be
pardoned by the critic, even though he should not be willing to reject a
good idea <i>of his own,</i> merely because some one else has, at some time
or other, been blessed with the same thought.</p>

<p>As the plan of this treatise is far more comprehensive than those of
ordinary grammars, the writer could not, without making his work
unreasonably voluminous, treat some topics as extensively as was
desirable. Its design is to embrace, not only all the most important
principles of the science, but also exercises in parsing, false syntax,
and punctuation, sufficiently extensive for all ordinary, practical
purposes, and a key to the exercises, and, moreover, a series of
illustrations so full and intelligible, as <i>completely to adapt the
principles to the capacities of common learners.</i> Whether this design
has been successfully or unsuccessfully executed, is left for the public
to decide. The general adoption of the work into schools, wherever it
has become known, and the ready sale of <i>forty thousand</i> copies, (though
<i>without hitherto affording the author any pecuniary profit,</i>) are
favorable omens.</p>

<p>In the selection and arrangement of principles for his work, the author
has endeavored to pursue a course between the extremes, of taking
blindly on trust whatever has been sanctioned by prejudice and the
authority of venerable names, and of that arrogant, innovating spirit,
which sets at defiance all authority, and attempts to overthrow all
former systems, and convince the world that all true knowledge and
science are wrapped up in a crude system of vagaries of its own
invention. Notwithstanding the author is aware that public prejudice is
powerful, and that he who ventures much by way of innovation, will be
liable to defeat his own purpose by falling into neglect; yet he has
taken the liberty to think for himself, to investigate the subject
critically and dispassionately, and to adopt such principles only as he
deemed the least objectionable, and best calculated to effect the object
he had in view. But what his system claims as improvements on others,
consists not so much in bettering the principles themselves, as in the
<i>method adopted of communicating a knowledge of them to the mind of the
learner</i>. That the work is defective, the author is fully sensible: and
he is free to acknowledge, that its defects arise, in part, from his own
want of judgment and skill. But there is another and a more serious
cause of them, namely, the anomalies and imperfections with which the
language abounds. This latter circumstance is also the cause of the
existence of so widely different opinions on many important points; and,
moreover, the reason that the grammatical principles of our language can
never be indisputably settled. But principles ought not to be rejected
because they admit of exceptions.&mdash;He who is thoroughly acquainted with
the genius and structure of our language, can duly appreciate the truth
of these remarks.</p>

<p>Should parents object to the Compendium, fearing it will soon be
destroyed by their children, they are informed that the pupil will not
have occasion to use it one-tenth part as much as he will the book which
it accompanies: and besides, if it be destroyed, he will find all the
definitions and rules which it contains, recapitulated in the series of
Lectures.</p>

<h3><b>HINTS TO TEACHERS AND PRIVATE LEARNERS.</b></h3>

<p>As this work proposes a new mode of parsing, and pursues an arrangement
essentially different from that generally adopted, it may not be deemed
improper for the author to give some directions to those who may be
disposed to use it. Perhaps they who take only a slight view of the
order of parsing, will not consider it <i>new</i>, but blend it with those
long since adopted. Some writers have, indeed, attempted plans somewhat
similar; but in no instance have they reduced them to what the author
considers a <i>regular systematic order</i>.</p>

<p>The methods which they have generally suggested, require the teacher to
<i>interrogate</i> the pupil as he proceeds; or else he is permitted to parse
without giving any explanations at all. Others hint that the learner
ought to apply definitions in a general way, but they lay down no
systematic arrangement of questions as his guide. The <i>systematic</i> order
laid down in this work, if pursued by the pupil, compels him to apply
every definition and every rule that appertains to each word he parses,
without having a question put to him by the teacher; and, in so doing,
he explains every word fully as he goes along. This course enables the
learner to proceed independently; and proves, at the same time, a great
relief to the instructer. The convenience and advantage of this method,
are far greater than can be easily conceived by one who is unacquainted
with it. The author is, therefore, anxious to have the absurd practice,
wherever it has been established, of causing learners to commit and
recite definitions and rules without any simultaneous application of
them to practical examples, immediately abolished. This system obviates
the necessity of pursuing such a stupid course of drudgery; for the
young beginner who pursues it, will have, in a few weeks, all the most
important definitions and rules perfectly committed, simply by applying
them in parsing.</p>

<p>If this plan be once adopted, it is confidently believed that every
teacher who is desirous to consult, either his own convenience, or the
advantage of his pupils, will readily pursue it in preference to any
former method. This belief is founded on the advantages which the
author himself has experienced from it in the course of several years,
devoted to the instruction of youth and adults. By pursuing this system,
he can, with less labor, advance a pupil farther in a practical
knowledge of this abstruse science, in <i>two months</i>, than he could in
<i>one year</i> when he taught in the &quot;old way.&quot; It is presumed that no
instructor, who once gives this system a fair trial, will doubt the
truth of this assertion.</p>

<p>Perhaps some will, on a first view of the work, disapprove of the
transposition of many parts; but whoever examines it attentively, will
find that, although the author has not followed the common &quot;artificial
and unnatural arrangement adopted by most of his predecessors,&quot; yet he
has endeavored to pursue a more judicious one, namely, &quot;the order of the
understanding.&quot;</p>

<p>The learner should commence, <i>not by committing and rehearsing</i>, but by
reading attentively the first <i>two</i> lectures several times over. He
ought then to parse, according to the <i>systematic order</i>, the examples
given for that purpose; in doing which, as previously stated, he has an
opportunity of committing all the definitions and rules belonging to the
parts of speech included in the examples.</p>

<p>The COMPENDIUM, as it presents to the eye of the learner a condensed but
comprehensive view of the whole science, may be properly considered an
&quot;Ocular Analysis of the English language.&quot; By referring to it, the young
student is enabled to apply all his definitions and rules from the very
commencement of his parsing. To some, this mode of procedure may seem
rather tedious; but it must appear obvious to every person of
discernment, that a pupil will learn more by parsing <i>five</i> words
critically, and explaining them fully, than he would by parsing <i>fifty</i>
words superficially, and without understanding their various properties.
The teacher who pursues this plan, is not under the necessity of hearing
his pupils recite a single lesson of <i>definitions</i> committed to memory,
for he has a fair opportunity of discovering their knowledge of these as
they evince it in parsing. All other directions necessary for the
learner in school, as well as for the <i>private learner</i>, will be given
in the succeeding pages of the work. Should these feeble efforts prove a
saving of much time and expense to those young persons who may be
disposed to pursue this science with avidity, by enabling them easily to
acquire a critical knowledge of a branch of education so important and
desirable, the author's fondest anticipations will be fully realized;
but should his work fall into the hands of any who are expecting, by the
acquisition, to become grammarians, and yet, have not sufficient
ambition and perseverance to make themselves acquainted with its
contents, it is hoped that the blame for their nonimprovement, will not
be thrown upon <i>him.</i></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="smalltext">To those enterprising and intelligent gentlemen who may be disposed to
lecture on this plan, the author takes the liberty to offer a few hints
by way of encouragement.</div>

<div class="smalltext">Any judicious instructor of grammar, if he take the trouble to make
himself familiar with the contents of the following pages, will find it
an easy matter to pursue this system. One remark only to the lecturer,
is sufficient. Instead of causing his pupils to acquire a knowledge of
the nature and use of the principles by intense application, let him
communicate it verbally; that is, let him first take up one part of
speech, and, in an oral lecture, unfold and explain all its properties,
not only by adopting the illustrations given in the book, but also by
giving others that may occur to his mind as he proceeds. After a part of
speech has been thus elucidated, the class should be interrogated on it,
and then taught to parse it, and correct errors in composition under the
rules that apply to it. In the same manner he may proceed with the other
parts of speech, observing, however, to recapitulate occasionally, until
the learners become thoroughly acquainted with whatever principles may
have been presented. If this plan be faithfully pursued, rapid progress,
on the part of the learner, will be the inevitable result; and that
teacher who pursues it, cannot fail of acquiring distinction, and an
enviable popularity in his profession. S. KIRKHAM.</div>

<p>You are about to enter upon one of the most useful, and, when rightly
pursued, one of the most interesting studies in the whole circle of
science. If, however, you, like many a misguided youth, are under the
impression that the study of grammar is dry and irksome, and a matter of
little consequence, I trust I shall succeed in removing from your mind,
all such false notions and ungrounded prejudices; for I will endeavor to
convince you, before I close these lectures, that this is not only a
pleasing study, but one of real and substantial utility; a study that
directly tends to adorn and dignify human nature, and meliorate the
condition of man. Grammar is a leading branch of that learning which
alone is capable of unfolding and maturing the mental powers, and of
elevating man to his proper rank in the scale of intellectual
existence;&mdash;of that learning which lifts the soul from earth, and
enables it to hold converse with a thousand worlds. In pursuing any and
every other path of science, you will discover the truth of these
remarks, and feel its force; for you will find, that, as grammar opens
the door to every department of learning, a knowledge of it is
indispensable: and should you not aspire at distinction in the republic
of letters, this knowledge cannot fail of being serviceable to you, even
if you are destined to pass through the humblest walks of life. I think
it is clear, that, in one point of view, grammatical knowledge possesses
a decisive advantage over every other branch of learning. Penmanship,
arithmetic, geography, astronomy, botany, chemistry, and so on, are
highly useful in their respective places; but not one of them is so
universally applicable to practical purposes, as this. In every
situation, under all circumstances, on all occasions;&mdash;when you speak,
read, write, or think, a knowledge of grammar is of essential utility.</p>

<p>Doubtless you have heard some persons assert, that they could detect and
correct any error in language by the ear, and speak and write accurately
without a knowledge of grammar. Now your own observation will soon
convince you, that this assertion is incorrect. A man of refined taste,
may, by perusing good authors, and conversing with the learned, acquire
that knowledge of language which will enable him to avoid those glaring
errors that offend the ear; but there are other errors equally gross,
which have not a harsh sound, and, consequently, which cannot be
detected without a knowledge of the rules that are violated. Believe me,
therefore, when I say, that without the knowledge and application of
grammar rules, it is impossible for any one to think, speak, read, or
write with accuracy. From a want of such knowledge, many often express
their ideas in a manner so improper and obscure as to render it
impossible for any one to <i>understand</i> them: their language frequently
amounts, not only to <i>bad</i> sense, but <i>non</i>-sense. In other instances
several different meanings may be affixed to the words they employ; and
what is still worse, is, that not unfrequently their sentences are so
constructed, as to convey a meaning quite the reverse of that which they
intended. Nothing of a secular nature can be more worthy of your
attention, then, than the acquisition of grammatical knowledge.</p>

<p>The path which leads to grammatical excellence, is not all the way
smooth and flowery, but in it you will find some thorns interspersed,
and some obstacles to be surmounted; or, in simple language, you will
find, in the pursuit of this science, many intricacies which it is
rather difficult for the juvenile mind completely to unravel. I shall,
therefore, as I proceed, address you in plain language, and endeavor to
illustrate every principle in a manner so clear and simple, that you
will be able, <i>if you exercise your mind,</i> to understand its nature, and
apply it to practice as you go along; for I would rather give you one
useful idea, than fifty high-sounding words, the meaning of which you
would probably be unable to comprehend.</p>

<p>Should you ever have any doubts concerning the meaning of a word, or the
sense of a sentence, you must not be discouraged, but persevere, either
by studying my explanations, or by asking some person competent to
inform you, till you obtain a clear conception of it, and till all
doubts are removed. By carefully examining, and frequently reviewing,
the following lectures, you will soon be able to discern the grammatical
construction of our language, and fix in your mind the principles by
which it is governed. Nothing delights youth so much, as a clear and
distinct knowledge of any branch of science which they are pursuing;
and, on the other hand, I know they are apt to be discouraged with any
branch of learning which requires much time and attention to be
understood. It is the evidence of a weak mind, however, to be
discouraged by the obstacles with which the young learner must expect to
meet; and the best means that you can adopt, in order to enable you to
overcome the difficulties that arise in the incipient stage of your
studies, is to cultivate the habit of <i>thinking methodically and
soundly</i> on all subjects of importance which may engage your attention.
Nothing will be more effectual in enabling you to think, as well as to
speak and write, correctly, than the study of English grammar, according
to the method of pursuing it as prescribed in the following pages. This
system is designed, and, I trust, well calculated, to expand and
strengthen the intellectual faculties, in as much as it involves a
process by which the mind is addressed, and a knowledge of grammar
communicated in an interesting and familiar manner.</p>

<p>You are aware, my young friend, that you live in an age of light and
knowledge;&mdash;an age in which science and the arts are marching onward
with gigantic strides. You live, too, in a land of liberty;&mdash;a land on
which the smiles of Heaven beam with uncommon refulgence. The trump of
the warrior and the clangor of arms no longer echo on our mountains, or
in our valleys; &quot;the garments dyed in blood have passed away;&quot; the
mighty struggle for independence is over; and you live to enjoy the rich
boon of freedom and prosperity which was purchased with the blood of our
fathers. These considerations forbid that you should ever be so
unmindful of your duty to your country, to your Creator, to yourself,
and to succeeding generations, as to be content to grovel in ignorance.
Remember that &quot;knowledge is power;&quot; that an enlightened and a virtuous
people can never be enslaved; and that, on the intelligence of our
youth, rest the future liberty, the prosperity, the happiness, the
grandeur, and the glory of our beloved country. Go on then, with a
laudable ambition, and an unyielding perseverance, in the path which
leads to honor and renown. Press forward. Go, and gather laurels on the
hill of science; linger among her unfading beauties; &quot;drink deep&quot; of her
crystal fountain; and then join in &quot;the march of fame.&quot; Become learned
and virtuous, and you will be great. Love God and serve him, and you
will be happy.</p>

<h2><b>LANGUAGE.</b></h2>

<p>Language, in its most extensive sense, implies those signs by which men
and brutes communicate to each other their thoughts, affections, and
desires.</p>

<p>Language may be divided, 1. into natural and artificial; 2. into spoken
and written.</p>

<p>NATURAL LANGUAGE, consists in the use of those natural signs which
different animals employ in communicating their feelings one to another.
The meaning of these signs all perfectly understand by the principles of
their nature. This language is common both to man and brute. The
elements of natural language in man, may be reduced to three kinds;
modulations of the voice, gestures, and features. By means of these, two
savages who have no common, artificial language, can communicate their
thoughts in a manner quite intelligible: they can ask and refuse, affirm
and deny, threaten and supplicate; they can traffick, enter into
contracts, and plight their faith. The language of brutes consists in
the use of those <i>inarticulate</i> sounds by which they express their
thoughts and affections. Thus, the chirping of a bird, the bleating of a
lamb, the neighing of a horse, and the growling, whining, and barking of
a dog, are the language of those animals, respectively.</p>

<p>ARTIFICIAL LANGUAGE consists in the use of words, by means of which
mankind are enabled to communicate their thoughts to one another.&mdash;In
order to assist you in comprehending what is meant by the term <i>word,</i> I
will endeavor to illustrate the meaning of the term.</p>

<p><i>Idea</i>. The <i>notices</i> which we gain by sensation and perception, and
which are treasured up in the mind to be the materials of thinking and
knowledge, are denominated ideas. For example, when you place your hand
upon a piece of ice, a sensation is excited which we call <i>coldness</i>.
That faculty which notices this sensation or change produced in the
mind, is called <i>perception;</i> and the abstract notice itself, or notion
you form of this sensation, is denominated an <i>idea</i>. This being
premised, we will now proceed to the consideration of words.</p>

<p><i>Words</i> are <i>articulate</i> sounds, used by common consent, not as natural,
but as artificial, signs of our ideas. Words have no meaning in
themselves. They are merely the artificial representatives of those
ideas affixed to them by compact or agreement among those who use them.
In English, for instance, to a particular kind of metal we assign the
name <i>gold;</i> not because there is, in that sound, any peculiar aptness
which suggests the idea we wish to convey, but the application of that
sound to the idea signified, is an act altogether arbitrary. Were there
any natural connexion between the sound and the thing signified, the
word <i>gold</i> would convey the same idea to the people of other countries
as it does to ourselves. But such is not the fact. Other nations make
use of different sounds to signify the same thing. Thus, <i>aurum</i> denotes
the same idea in Latin, and <i>or</i> in French. Hence it follows, that it is
by custom only we learn to annex particular ideas to particular sounds.</p>

<p>SPOKEN LANGUAGE or speech is made up of articulate sounds uttered by the
human voice.</p>

<p><i>The voice</i> is formed by air which, after it passes through the glottis,
(a small aperture in the upper part of the wind-pipe,) is modulated by
the action of the throat, palate, teeth, tongue, lips, and nostrils.</p>

<p>WRITTEN LANGUAGE. The elements of written language consist of letters or
characters, which, by common consent and general usage, are combined
into words, and thus made the ocular representatives of the articulate
sounds uttered by the voice.</p>

<h2><a name="GRAMMAR"></a>GRAMMAR.</h2>

<div class="bigtext">GRAMMAR is the science of language.</div>

<p>Grammar may be divided into two species, universal and particular.</p>

<p>UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR explains the principles which are common to all
languages.</p>

<p>PARTICULAR GRAMMAR applies those general principles to a particular
language, modifying them according to its genius, and the established
practice of the best speakers and writers by whom it is used. Hence,</p>

<a name="grammatical_accuracy"></a>
<p><i>The established practice of the best speakers and writers</i> of any
language, is the standard of grammatical accuracy in the use of that
language.</p>

<p>By the phrase, <i>established practice,</i> is implied reputable, national,
and present usage. A usage becomes <i>good</i> and <i>legal,</i> when it has been
long and generally adopted.</p>

<p><i>The best speakers and writers,</i> or such as may be considered good
authority in the use of language, are those who are deservedly in high
estimation; speakers, distinguished for their elocution and other
literary attainments, and writers, eminent for correct taste, solid
matter, and refined manner.</p>

<div class="smalltext">In the grammar of a <i>perfect</i> language, no rules should be admitted, but
such as are founded on fixed principles, arising out of the genius of
that language and the nature of things; but our language being
<i>im</i>-perfect, it becomes necessary, in a <i>practical</i> treatise, like
this, to adopt some rules to direct us in the use of speech as regulated
by <i>custom</i>. If we had a permanent and surer standard than capricious
custom to regulate us in the transmission of thought, great
inconvenience would be avoided. They, however, who introduce usages
which depart from the analogy and philosophy of a language, are
conspicuous among the number of those who form that language, and have
power to control it.</div>

<div class="smalltext">Language is conventional, and not only invented, but, in its progressive
advancement, <i>varied</i> for purposes of practical convenience. Hence it
assumes any and every form which those who make use of it choose to give
it. We are, therefore, as <i>rational</i> and <i>practical</i> grammarians,
compelled to submit to the necessity of the case; to take the language
as it <i>is</i>, and not as it <i>should be</i>, and bow to custom.</div>

<p><a name="PHILOSOPHICAL_GRAMMAR"></a>PHILOSOPHICAL GRAMMAR investigates and develops the principles of
language, as founded in the nature of things and the original laws of
thought. It also discusses the grounds of the classification of words,
and explains those procedures which practical grammar lays down for our
observance.</p>

<p>PRACTICAL GRAMMAR adopts the most convenient classification of the words
of a language, lays down a system of definitions and rules, founded on
scientific principles and good usage, illustrates their nature and
design, and enforces their application.</p>

<p>PRINCIPLE. A principle in grammar is a peculiar construction of the
language, sanctioned by good usage.</p>

<p>DEFINITION. A definition in grammar is a principle of language expressed
in a definite form.</p>

<p>RULE. A rule describes the peculiar construction or circumstantial
relation of words, which custom has established for our observance.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<h2><b>ENGLISH GRAMMAR.</b></h2>

<div class="bigtext">ENGLISH GRAMMAR is the art of speaking and writing the English language
with propriety.</div>

<p>GRAMMAR teaches us <i>how to use words in a proper manner.</i> The most
important use of that faculty called speech, is, to convey our thoughts
to others. If, therefore, we have a store of words, and even know what
they signify, they will be of no real use to us unless we can also apply
them to practice, and make them answer the purposes for which they were
invented. <i>Grammar</i>, well understood, enables us to express our
thoughts fully and clearly; and, consequently, in a manner which will
defy the ingenuity of man to give our words any other meaning than that
which we ourselves intend them to express. To be able to speak and write
our vernacular tongue with accuracy and elegance, is, certainly, a
consideration of the highest moment.</p>
<br />

<a name="ORTHOGRAPHY_i"></a>
<div class="bigtext">Grammar is divided into four parts;</div>

<ol><li>ORTHOGRAPHY,</li>
<li>ETYMOLOGY,</li>
<li>SYNTAX,</li>
<li>PROSODY.</li></ol>


<div class="bigtext">ORTHOGRAPHY teaches the nature and powers of
letters, and the just method of spelling words.</div>

<p>ORTHOGRAPHY means <i>word-making</i>, or <i>spelling</i>. It teaches us the
different kinds and sounds of letters, how to combine them into
syllables, and syllables into words.</p>

<p>As this is one of the first steps in the path of literature, I presume
you already understand the nature and use of letters, and the just
method of spelling words. If you do, it is unnecessary for you to dwell
long on this part of grammar, which, though very important, is rather
dry and uninteresting, for it has nothing to do with parsing and
analyzing language. And, therefore, if you can <i>spell correctly</i>, you
may omit Orthography, and commence with Etymology and Syntax.</p>

<div class="bigtext">Orthography treats, 1st, of <i>Letters</i>, 2ndly, of <i>Syllables</i>, and 3dly,
of <i>Words</i>.</div>

<div class="bigtext">I. LETTERS. A letter is the first principle, or least part, of a word.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The English Alphabet contains twenty-six letters.</div>

<div class="bigtext">They are divided into vowels and consonants.</div>

<div class="bigtext">A vowel is a letter that can be perfectly sounded by itself. The vowels
are <i>a, e, i, o, u,</i> and sometimes <i>w</i> and <i>y</i>. <i>W</i> and <i>y</i> are
consonants when they begin a word or syllable; but in every other
situation they are vowels.</div>

<div class="bigtext">A consonant is a letter that cannot be perfectly sounded without the
help of a vowel; as, <i>b, d, f, l</i>. All letters except the vowels are
consonants.</div>

<div class="bigtext">Consonants are divided into mutes and semi-vowels.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The mutes cannot be sounded <i>at all</i> without the aid of a vowel. They
are <i>b, p, t, d, k</i>, and <i>c</i> and <i>g</i> hard.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The semi-vowels have an imperfect sound of themselves. They are <i>f, l,
m, n, r, v, s, z, x</i>, and <i>c</i> and <i>g</i> soft.</div>

<div class="smalltext">Four of the semi-vowels, namely, <i>l, m, n, r</i>, are called <i>liquids</i>,
because they readily unite with other consonants, and flow, as it were,
into their sounds.</div>

<div class="bigtext">A diphthong is the union of <i>two</i> vowels, pronounced by a single impulse
of the voice; as <i>oi</i> in voice, <i>ou</i> in sound.</div>

<div class="bigtext">A triphthong is the union of <i>three</i> vowels pronounced in like manner;
as, <i>eau</i> in beau, <i>iew</i> in view.</div>

<div class="smalltext">A <i>proper</i> diphthong has <i>both</i> the vowels sounded; as, <i>ou</i> in ounce.
An <i>improper</i> diphthong has only <i>one</i> of the vowels sounded; as, <i>oa</i>
in boat.</div>

<div class="bigtext">II. SYLLABLES. A Syllable is a distinct sound, uttered by a single
impulse of the voice; as, <i>a, an, ant</i>.</div>

<div class="bigtext">A word of one syllable, is termed a Monosyllable; a word of two
syllables, a Dissyllable; a word of three syllables, a Trisyllable; a
word of four or more syllables, a Polysyllable.</div>

<div class="bigtext">III. WORDS. Words are articulate sounds, used by common consent, as
signs of our ideas.</div>

<div class="bigtext">Words are of two sorts, primitive and derivative.</div>

<div class="bigtext">A <i>primitive</i> word is that which cannot be reduced to a simpler word in
the language; as, <i>man, good</i>.</div>

<div class="bigtext">A <i>derivative</i> word is that which may be reduced to a simpler word; as,
<i>manful, goodness</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext">There is little or no difference between derivative and compound words.
The <a name="terminations_i"></a>terminations or added syllables, such as <i>ed, es, ess, est, an, ant,
en, ence, ent, dom, hood, ly, ous, ful, ness</i>, and the like, were,
originally, distinct and separate words, which, by long use, have been
contracted, and made to coalesce with other words.</div>

<h2>OF THE <a name="SOUNDS_OF_THE_LETTERS"></a>SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS.</h2>

<p>A.&mdash;<i>A</i> has four sounds; the long; as in <i>name, basin</i>; the broad; as in

in <i>Baal, Gaal, Aaron</i>.</p>

<p>The Latin diphthong, <i>ae</i>, has the long sound of <i>e</i> in <i>aenigma,
Caesar</i>, and some other words. But many authors reject this useless
excrescence of antiquity, and write, <i>enigma, Cesar</i>.</p>

<p>The termination, <i>ed</i>, in adjectives and participial adjectives, retains
its distinct sound; as, a <i>wick-ed</i> man, a <i>learn-ed</i> man, <i>bless-ed</i>
are the meek; but in verbs the <i>e</i> is generally dropped; as, <i>passed,

pronounced like short <i>e</i> in <i>bury</i>; and like short <i>i</i> in <i>busy,
business</i>.</p>

<p>V.&mdash;<i>V</i> has uniformly the sound of flat <i>f</i>; as in <i>vanity, love</i>.</p>

<p>W.&mdash;<i>W</i>, when a consonant, has its sound, which is heard in <i>wo,
beware</i>. <i>W</i> is silent before <i>r</i>; as in <i>wry, wrap, wrinkle</i>; and also
in <i>answer, sword</i>, &amp;c. Before <i>h</i> it is pronounced as if written after
the <i>h</i>; as in <i>why, when, what</i>;&mdash;<i>hwy, hwen, hwat</i>. When heard as a
vowel, it takes the sound of <i>u</i>; as in <i>draw, crew, now</i>.</p>

<p>X.&mdash;<i>X</i> has a sharp sound, like <i>ks</i>, when it ends a syllable with the
accent on it; as, <i>exit, exercise</i>; or when it precedes an accented
syllable which begins with any consonant except <i>h</i>; as, <i>excuse,
extent</i>; but when the following accented syllable begins with a vowel or
<i>h</i>, it has, generally, a flat sound, like <i>gz</i>; as in <i>exert, exhort</i>.
<i>X</i> has the sound of <i>Z</i> at the beginning of proper names of Greek
original; as in <i>Xanthus, Xenophon, Xerxes</i>.</p>

<p>Y.&mdash;<i>Y</i>, when a consonant, has its proper sound; as in <i>youth, York,
yes, new-year</i>. When <i>y</i> is employed as a vowel, it has exactly the
sound that <i>i</i> would have in the same situation; as in <i>rhyme, system,
party, pyramid</i>.</p>

<p>Z.&mdash;<i>Z</i> has the sound of flat <i>s</i>; as in <i>freeze, brazen</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="RULES_FOR_SPELLING"></a>RULES FOR SPELLING.</h2>

<div class="bigtext">SPELLING is the art of expressing a word by its proper letters.</div>

<p>The following rules are deemed important in practice, although they
assist us in spelling only a small portion of the words of our language.
This useful art is to be chiefly acquired by studying the spelling-book
and dictionary, and by strict attention in reading.</p>

<p>RULE I. Monosyllables ending in <i>f, l</i>, or <i>s</i>, double the final or
ending consonant when it is preceded by a <i>single</i> vowel; as <i>staff,
mill, pass</i>. Exceptions; <i>of, if, is, as, lids, was, yes, his, this,
us</i>, and <i>thus</i>.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><i>False Orthography for the learner to correct</i>.&mdash;Be thou like the
gale that moves the gras, to those who ask thy aid.&mdash;The aged hero
comes forth on his staf; his gray hair glitters in the beam.&mdash;Shal
mortal man be more just than God?&mdash;Few know the value of health til
they lose it.&mdash;Our manners should be neither gros, nor excessively
refined.</div>

<div class="poem">
<span class="poem.span">And that is not the lark, whose notes do beat</span>
<span class="poem.span">The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:</span>
<span class="poem.span">I have more care to stay, than wil to go.</span>
</div>


<p>RULE II. Monosyllables ending in any consonant but <i>f, l</i>, or <i>s</i>, never
double the final consonant when it is preceded by a <i>single</i> vowel; as,
<i>man, hat</i>. Exceptions; <i>add, ebb, butt, egg, odd, err, inn, bunn,
purr</i>, and <i>buzz</i>.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><i>False Orthography</i>.&mdash;None ever went sadd from Fingal.&mdash;He rejoiced
over his sonn.&mdash;Clonar lies bleeding on the bedd of death.&mdash;Many a
trapp is set to insnare the feet of youth.</div>

<div class="poem">
<span class="poem.span">The weary sunn has made a golden sett,</span>
<span class="poem.span">And, by the bright track of his golden carr,</span>
<span class="poem.span">Gives token of a goodly day to-morrow.</span>
</div>


<p>RULE III. Words ending in <i>y</i>, form the plural of nouns, the persons of
verbs, participial nouns, past participles, comparatives, and
superlatives, by changing <i>y</i> into <i>i</i>, when the <i>y</i> is preceded by a
<i>consonant</i>; as, <i>spy, spies; I carry, thou carriest, he carries;
carrier, carried; happy, happier, happiest</i>.</p>

<p>The present participle in <i>ing</i>, retains the <i>y</i> that <i>i</i> may not be
doubled; as, <i>carry, carrying</i>.</p>

<p>But when <i>y</i> is preceded by a <i>vowel</i>, in such instances as the above,
it is not changed into <i>i</i>; as, <i>boy, boys; I cloy, he cloys</i>; except
in the words <i>lay, pay</i>, and <i>say I</i> from which are formed <i>laid, paid</i>,
and <i>said</i>; and their compounds, <i>unpaid, unsaid</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<i>False Orthography</i>.&mdash;Our fancys should be governed by reason.&mdash;Thou
wearyest thyself in vain.&mdash;He denyed himself all sinful pleasures.</div>

<div class="poem">
<span class="poem.span">Win straiing souls with modesty and love;</span>
<span class="poem.span">Cast none away.</span></div>
<div class="blkquot">
The truly good man is not dismaied by poverty.<br />
Ere fresh morning streak the east, we must be risen to reform yonder allies green.</div>

<p>RULE IV. When words ending in <i>y</i>, assume an additional syllable
beginning with a consonant, the <i>y</i>, if it is preceded by a consonant,
is commonly changed to <i>i</i>; as, <i>happy, happily, happiness</i>.</p>

<p>But when <i>y</i> is preceded by a vowel, in such instances, it is very
rarely changed to <i>i</i>; as, <i>coy, coyless; boy, boyish; boyhood; joy,
joyless, joyful</i>.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><i>False Orthography</i>.&mdash;His mind is uninfluenced by fancyful
humors.&mdash;The vessel was heavyly laden.&mdash;When we act against
conscience, we become the destroiers of our own peace.</div>

<div class="poem">
<span class="poem.span">Christiana, mayden of heroic mien!</span>
<span class="poem.span">Star of the north! of northern stars the queen!</span>
</div>


<p>RULE V. Monosyllables, and words accented on the last syllable,
ending with a single consonant that is preceded by a single vowel,
double that consonant when they assume another syllable that begins
with a vowel; as, <i>wit, witty; thin, thinnish; to abet, an abetter</i>.</p>

<p>But if a diphthong precedes, or the accent is <i>not</i> on the last
syllable, the consonant remains single; as, <i>to toil, toiling; to offer,
an offering; maid, maiden</i>.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><i>False Orthography</i>.&mdash;The business of to-day, should not be defered
till to-morrow.&mdash;That law is annuled.&mdash;When we have outstriped our
errors we have won the race.&mdash;By defering our repentance, we
accumulate our sorrows.&mdash;The Christian Lawgiver has prohibited many
things which the heathen philosophers allowed.</div>

<span class="poem.span">Thus mourned the hapless man; a thunderring sound</span>
<span class="poem.span">Rolled round the shudderring walls and shook the ground.</span>
</div>

<p>RULE VI. Words ending in double <i>l</i>, in taking <i>ness, less, ly</i>, or
<i>ful</i>, after them, generally omit one <i>l</i>; as, <i>fulness, skilless, fully
skilful</i>.</p>

<p>But words ending in any double letter but <i>l</i>, and taking <i>ness, less,
ly</i>, or <i>ful</i>, after them, preserve the letter double; as,
<i>harmlessness, carelessness, carelessly, stiffly, successful</i>.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><i>False Orthography</i>.&mdash;A chillness generally precedes a fever.&mdash;He is
wed to dullness.</div>

regions, is as open to the peasant as to the king.&mdash;The arrows of
calumny fall harmlesly at the feet of virtue.</div>

<p>RULE VII. <i>Ness, less, ly</i>, or <i>ful</i>, added to words ending in silent
<i>e</i>, does not cut it off; as, <i>paleness, guileless, closely, peaceful</i>;
except in a few words; as, <i>duly, truly, awful</i>.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><i>False Orthography</i>.&mdash;Sedatness is becoming.</div>

<div class="poem">
<span class="poem.span">All these with ceasless praise his works behold.</span>

<span class="poem.span">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Nature made a pause,</span>
<span class="poem.span">An aweful pause! prophetic of her end!</span></div>

<p>RULE VIII. When words ending in silent <i>e</i>, assume the termination,
<i>ment</i>, the <i>e</i> should not be cut off; as, <i>abatement, chastisement</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ment</i>, like other terminations, changes <i>y</i> into <i>i</i> when the <i>y</i> is
preceded by a consonant; as, <i>accompany, accompaniment; merry,
merriment</i>.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><i>False Orthography</i>.&mdash;A judicious arrangment of studies facilitates

<span class="poem.span">To shun allurments is not hard,</span>
<span class="poem.span">To minds resolv'd, forwarn'd, and well prepared.</span></div>

<p>RULE IX. When words ending in silent <i>e</i>, assume the termination, <i>able</i>
or <i>ible</i>, the <i>e</i> should generally be cut off; as, <i>blame, blamable;
cure, curable; sense, sensible</i>. But if <i>c</i> or <i>g</i> soft comes before <i>e</i>
in the original word, the <i>e</i> is preserved in words compounded with
<i>able</i>; as, <i>peace, peaceable; change, changeable</i>.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><i>False Orthography</i>.&mdash;Knowledge is desireable.&mdash;Misconduct is
inexcuseable.&mdash;Our natural defects are not chargable upon us.&mdash;We
are made to be servicable to others as well as to ourselves.</div>

<p>RULE X. When <i>ing</i> or <i>ish</i> is added to words ending in silent
<i>e</i>, the <i>e</i> is almost always omitted; as, <i>place, placing; lodge,
lodging; slave, slavish; prude, prudish</i>.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><i>False Orthography</i>.&mdash;Labor and expense are lost upon a droneish
spirit.&mdash;An obligeing and humble disposition, is totally unconnected

<span class="poem.span">One self-approveing hour, whole years outweighs</span>
<span class="poem.span">Of stupid starers, and of loud huzzas.</span></div>

<p>RULE XI. Compound words are generally spelled in the same manner as the
simple words of which they are compounded; as, <i>glasshouse, skylight,
thereby, hereafter</i>. Many words ending in double <i>l</i>, are exceptions to
this rule; as, <i>already, welfare, wilful, fulfil</i>; and also the words,
<i>wherever, christmas, lammas, &amp;c</i>.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><i>False Orthography</i>.&mdash;The Jew's pasover was instituted in A.M.

<a name="ETYMOLOGY_AND_SYNTAX"></a>
<h2>ETYMOLOGY AND SYNTAX</h2>


<h3>LECTURE II</h3>

<h4>OF NOUNS AND VERBS.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">ETYMOLOGY treats of the different sorts of words, their various
modifications, and their derivation.</div>

<div class="bigtext">SYNTAX treats of the agreement and government of words, and of their
proper arrangement in a sentence.</div>

<div class="smalltext">The word ETYMOLOGY signifies the <i>origin</i> or <i>pedigree of words</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext"><i>Syn</i>, a prefix from the Greek, signifies <i>together</i>. <i>Syn-tax</i>, means
<i>placing together</i>; or, as applied in grammar, <i>sentence making</i>.</div>

<p>The rules of syntax, which direct to the proper choice of words, and
their judicious arrangement in a sentence, and thereby enable us to
correct and avoid errors in speech, are chiefly based on principles
unfolded and explained by Etymology. Etymological knowledge, then, is a
prerequisite to the study of Syntax; but, in parsing, under the head of
Etymology, you are required to apply the rules of Syntax. It becomes
necessary, therefore, in a practical work of this sort, to treat these
two parts of grammar in connexion.</p>

<p>Conducted on scientific principles, Etymology would comprehend the
exposition of the origin and meaning of words, and, in short, their
whole history, including their application to things in accordance with
the laws of nature and of thought, and the caprice of those who apply
them; but to follow up the current of language to its various sources,
and analyze the springs from which it flows, would involve a process
altogether too arduous and extensive for an elementary work. It would
lead to the study of all those languages from which ours is immediately
derived, and even compel us to trace many words through those languages
to others more ancient, and so on, until the chain of research would
become, if not endless, at least, too extensive to be traced out by one
man. I shall, therefore, confine myself to the following, limited views
of this part of grammar.</p>

<p>1. Etymology treats of the <i>classification</i> of words.</p>

<p>2. Etymology explains the <i>accidents</i> or <i>properties</i> peculiar to each
class or sort of words, and their present <i>modifications</i>. By
modifications, I mean the changes produced on their <i>endings</i>, in
consequence of their assuming different relations in respect to one
another. These changes, such as fruit, fruit<i>s</i>, fruit'<i>s</i>; he, h<i>is</i>,
h<i>im</i>; write, write<i>st</i>, write<i>th</i>, write<i>s</i>, wr<i>ote</i>, writ<i>ten</i>,
writ<i>ing</i>, write<i>r</i>; a, a<i>n</i>; ample, ampl<i>y</i>, and the like, will be
explained in their appropriate places.</p>

<a name="derivation_i"></a>
<p>3. Etymology treats of the <i>derivation</i> of words; that is, it teaches
you <i>how one word comes from</i>, or <i>grows out of</i> another. For example,
from the word speak, come the words speak<i>est</i>, speak<i>eth</i>, speak<i>s</i>,
speak<i>ing</i>, sp<i>oke</i>, spo<i>ken</i>, speak<i>er</i>, speak<i>er's</i>, speak<i>ers</i>.
These, you perceive, are all one and the same word, and all, except the
last three, express the same kind of action. They differ from each other
only in the termination. These changes in termination are produced on
the word in order to make it correspond with the various <i>persons</i> who
speak, the <i>number</i> of persons, or the <i>time</i> of speaking; as, <i>I</i>
speak, <i>thou</i> speak<i>est</i>, the <i>man</i> speak<i>eth</i>, or speak<i>s</i>, the <i>men</i>
speak, <i>I</i> sp<i>oke</i>; The speak<i>er</i> speak<i>s</i> another speak<i>er's</i> spe<i>ech</i>.</p>

<p>The third part of Etymology, which is intimately connected with the
second, will be more amply expanded in Lecture XIV, and in the
Philosophical notes; but I shall not treat largely of that branch of
derivation which consists in tracing words to foreign languages. This is
the province of the lexicographer, rather than of the philologist. It is
not the business of him who writes a practical, English grammar, to
trace words to the Saxon, nor to the Celtic, the Greek, the Dutch, the
Mexican, nor the Persian; nor is it his province to explain their
meaning in Latin, French, or Hebrew, Italian, Mohegan, or Sanscrit; but
it is his duty to explain their properties, their powers, their
connexions, relations, dependancies, and, bearings, not at the period in
which the Danes made an irruption into the island of Great Britain, nor
in the year in which Lamech paid his addresses to Adah and Zillah, but
<i>at the particular period in which he writes</i>. His words are already
derived, formed, established, and furnished to his hand, and he is bound
to take them and explain them as he finds them <i>in his day</i>, without any
regard to their ancient construction and application.</p>

<h3>CLASSIFICATION.</h3>

<p>In arranging the parts of speech, I conceive it to be
the legitimate object of the practical grammarian, to consult <i>practical
convenience</i>. The true principle of classification seems to be, not a
reference to essential differences in the <i>primitive</i> meaning of words,
nor to their original combinations, but to the <i>manner in which they are
at present employed</i>. In the early and rude state of society, mankind
are quite limited in their knowledge, and having but few ideas to
communicate, a small number of words answers their purpose in the
transmission of thought. This leads them to express their ideas in
short, detached sentences, requiring few or none of those <i>connectives</i>,
or words of transition, which are afterwards introduced into language by
refinement, and which contribute so largely to its perspicuity and
elegance. The argument appears to be conclusive, then, that every
language must necessarily have more parts of speech in its refined, than
in its barbarous state.</p>

<p>The part of speech to which any word belongs, is ascertained, not by the
<i>original</i> signification of that word, but by its present <i>manner</i> of
meaning, or, rather, <i>the office which it performs in a sentence</i>.</p>

<a name="manner_of_meaning_i"></a>
<p>The various ways in which a word is applied to the idea which it
represents, are called its <i>manner of meaning</i>. Thus, The painter dips
his <i>paint</i> brush in <i>paint</i>, to <i>paint</i> the carriage. Here, the word
<i>paint</i>, is first employed to <i>describe</i> the brush which the painter
uses; in this situation it is, therefore, an <i>adjective</i>; secondly, to
<i>name</i> the mixture employed; for which reason it is a <i>noun</i>; and,
lastly, to <i>express the action</i> performed; it therefore, becomes a
<i>verb</i>; and yet, the meaning of the word is the same in all these
applications. This meaning, however, is applied in different ways; and
thus the same word becomes different parts of speech. Richard took
<i>water</i> from the <i>water</i> pot, to <i>water</i> the plants.</p>

<h3>ETYMOLOGY.</h3>

<p>Etymology treats, first, of the <i>classification</i> of words.</p>

<p>THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE is derived chiefly from the Saxon, Danish, Celtic,
and Gothic; but in the progressive stages of its refinement, it has been
greatly enriched by accessions from the Greek, Latin, French, Spanish,
Italian, and German languages.</p>

<p>The number of words in our language, after deducting proper names, and
words formed by the inflections of our verbs, nouns, and adjectives, may
be estimated at about <i>forty thousand</i>.</p>


<div class="bigtext">There are ten sorts of words, called parts of speech, namely, the NOUN
or SUBSTANTIVE, VERB, ARTICLE, ADJECTIVE, PARTICIPLE, ADVERB,
PREPOSITION, PRONOUN, CONJUNCTION, and INTERJECTION.</div>

<p>Thus you perceive, that all the words in the English language are
included in these ten classes: and what you have to do in acquiring a
knowledge of English Grammar, is merely to become acquainted with these
ten parts of speech, and the rules of Syntax that apply to them. The
<i>Noun</i> and <i>Verb</i> are the most important and leading parts of speech;
therefore they are first presented: all the rest (except the
interjection) are either appendages or connectives of these two. As you
proceed, you will find that it will require more time, and cost you more
labor, to get a knowledge of the noun and verb, than it will to become
familiar with all the minor parts of speech.</p>

<p>The principal use of words is, to <i>name</i> things, <i>compare</i> them with
each other, and <i>express their actions</i>.</p>

<p><i>Nouns</i>, which are the names of entities or things, <i>adjectives</i> which
denote the comparisons and relations of things by describing them, and
expressing their qualities, and <i>verbs</i>, which express the actions and
being of things, are the only classes of words necessarily recognised
in a philosophical view of grammar. But in a treatise which consults,
mainly, the <i>practical</i> advantages of the learner, it is believed, that
no classification will be found more convenient or accurate than the
foregoing, which divides words into ten sorts. To attempt to prove, in
this place, that nothing would be gained by adopting either a less or a
greater number of the parts of speech, would be anticipating the
subject. I shall, therefore, give my reasons for adopting this
arrangement in preference to any other, as the different sorts of words
are respectively presented to you, for then you will be better prepared
to appreciate my arguments.</p>
<br />

<h3>OF <a name="NOUNS"></a>NOUNS.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">A noun is the name of any person, place, or thing; as, <i>man, Charleston,
knowledge</i>.</div>

<p>Nouns are often improperly called <i>substantives</i>. A substantive is the
name of a <i>substance</i> only; but a noun is the name either of a
<i>substance</i> or a <i>quality</i>.</p>

<p><i>Noun</i>, derived from the Latin word <i>nomen</i>, signifies <i>name</i>. The name
of any thing<sup><a name='FN_anchor_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_1'>[1]</a></sup> that exists, whether animate or inanimate, or
which we can see, hear, feel, taste, smell, or think of, is a noun.
<i>Animal, bird, creature, paper, pen, apple, fold, house, modesty,
virtue, danger</i>, are all nouns. In order that you may easily distinguish
this part of speech from others, I will give you a <i>sign</i>, which will be
useful to you when you cannot tell it by the <i>sense</i>. Any word that will
make sense with <i>the</i> before it, is a noun. Try the following words by
this sign, and see if they are nouns: tree, mountain, soul, mind,
conscience, understanding. <i>The</i> tree, <i>the</i> mountain, <i>the</i> soul, and
so on. You perceive, that they will make sense with <i>the</i> prefixed;
therefore you know they are <i>nouns</i>. There are, however, exceptions to
this rule, for some nouns will not make sense with <i>the</i> prefixed. These
you will be able to distinguish, if you exercise your mind, by their
<i>making sense of themselves</i>; as, <i>goodness, sobriety, hope,
immortality</i>.</p>


<p>Nouns are used to denote the nonentity or absence of a thing, as well as
its reality; as, <i>nothing, naught, vacancy, non-existence,
invisibility</i>.</p>

<p>Nouns are sometimes used as verbs, and verbs, as nouns, according to
their <i>manner</i> of meaning; and nouns are sometimes used as adjectives,
and adjectives, as nouns. This matter will be explained in the
concluding part of this lecture, where you will be better prepared to
comprehend it.</p>

<div class="bigtext">NOUNS are of two kinds, common and proper.</div>

<div class="bigtext">A <i>Common noun</i> is the name of a sort or species of things; as, <i>man,
tree, river</i>.</div>

<div class="bigtext">A <i>Proper noun</i> is the name of an individual; as, <i>Charles, Ithaca,
Ganges</i>.</div>

<div class="bigtext">A noun signifying many, is called a <i>collective noun</i>, or <i>noun of
multitude</i>; as, the <i>people</i>, the <i>army</i>.</div>

<p>The distinction between a common and a proper noun, is very obvious. For
example: <i>boy</i> is a common noun, because it is a name applied to <i>all</i>
boys; but <i>Charles</i> is a proper noun, because it is the name of an
<i>individual</i> boy. Although many boys may have the same name, yet you
know it is not a common noun, for the name Charles is <i>not</i> given to all
boys. <i>Mississippi</i> is a proper noun, because it is the name of an
individual river; but <i>river</i> is a common noun, because it is the name
of a <i>species</i> of things, and the name <i>river</i> is common to <i>all</i>
rivers.</p>

<p>Nouns which denote the genus, species, or variety of beings or things,
are always common; as, <i>tree</i>, the genus; <i>oak, ash, chestnut, poplar</i>,
different species; and red <i>oak</i>, white <i>oak</i>, black <i>oak</i>, varieties.
The word earth, when it signifies a kind or quantity of dirt, is a
common noun; but when it denotes the planet we inhabit, it is a proper
noun. The <i>words</i> person, place, river, mountain, lake, &amp;c. are <i>common
nouns</i>, because they are the names of whole <i>species</i>, or classes of
things containing many sorts; but the <i>names</i> of persons, places,
rivers, mountains, lakes, &amp;c. are <i>proper nouns</i>, because they denote
<i>individuals</i>; as, Augustus, Baltimore, Alps, Huron.</p>

<p><i>Physician, lawyer, merchant</i>, and <i>shoemaker</i>, are common nouns,
because these names are common to classes of men. <i>God</i> and <i>Lord</i>, when
applied to Jehovah or Jesus Christ, are proper; but when employed to
denote heathen or false <i>gods</i>, or temporal <i>lords</i>, they are common.
The Notes and remarks throughout the work, though of minor importance,
demand your attentive and careful perusal.</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">1. When <i>proper</i> nouns have an article annexed to them, they are
used after the manner of <i>common</i> nouns; as, &quot;Bolivar is styled
<i>the</i> Washington of South America.&quot;</div>

<div class="smalltext">2. <i>Common</i> nouns are sometimes used to signify <i>individuals</i>, when
articles or pronouns are prefixed to them; as, &quot;<i>The</i> boy is
studious; <i>That</i> girl is discreet.&quot; In such instances, they are
nearly equivalent to proper nouns.</div>

<div class="smalltext">3. <i>Common</i> nouns are sometimes subdivided into the following
classes: <i>Nouns of Multitude</i>; as, The people, the parliament:
<i>Verbal or participial nouns</i>; as, The beginning, reading, writing;
and <i>Abstract nouns</i>, or the names of qualities abstracted from
their substances; as, knowledge, virtue, goodness. Lest the student
be led to blend the idea of abstract nouns with that of adjectives,
both of which denote qualities, a farther illustration appears to be
necessary, in order to mark the distinction between these two parts
of speech. An abstract noun denotes a quality considered <i>apart</i>
(that is, abstracted) <i>from</i> the substance or being to which it
belongs; but an adjective denotes a quality <i>joined</i> (adjected) <i>to</i>
the substance or being to which it belongs. Thus, <i>whiteness</i> and
<i>white</i> both denote the same quality; but we speak of whiteness as a
distinct object of thought, while we use the word <i>white</i> always in
reference to the noun to which it belongs; as, <i>white</i> paper,
<i>white</i> mouse.</div>

<div class="smalltext">4. Some authors have proceeded to still more minute divisions and
sub-divisions of nouns; such, for example, as the following, which
appear to be more complex than useful: <i>Natural nouns</i>, or names of
things formed by nature; as, man, beast, water, air: 2. <i>Artificial</i>
<i>nouns</i>, or names of things formed by art; as, book, vessel, house:
3. <i>Personal nouns</i>, or those which stand for human beings; as, man,
woman, Edwin: 4. <i>Neuter nouns</i>, or those which denote things
inanimate; as, book, field, mountain, Cincinnati. The following,
however, is quite a rational division: <i>Material nouns</i> are the
names of things formed of matter; as, stone, book: <i>Immaterial</i>
<i>nouns</i> are the names of things having no substance; as, hope,
immortality.</div>

<div class="bigtext">To nouns belong gender, person, number, and case.</div>

<h3><a name="GENDER"></a>GENDER.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">GENDER is the distinction of sex. Nouns have three genders, the
masculine, the feminine, and the neuter.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>masculine gender</i> denotes males; as, a <i>man</i>, a <i>boy</i>.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>feminine gender</i> denotes females; as, a <i>woman</i>, a <i>girl</i>.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>neuter gender</i> denotes things without sex; as, a <i>hat</i>, a <i>stick</i>.</div>

<p><i>Neuter</i> means <i>neither:</i> therefore neuter gender signifies neither
gender; that is, neither masculine nor feminine. Hence, neuter gender
means <i>no gender</i>. Strictly speaking, then, as there are but two sexes,
nouns have but <i>two</i> genders; but for the sake of practical convenience,
we apply to them three genders, by calling that a gender which is <i>no</i>
gender. The English and the pure Persian, appear to be the only
languages which observe, in the distinction of sex, the natural division
of nouns.&mdash;The genders of nouns are so easily known, that a farther
explanation of them is unnecessary, except what is given in the
following</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">1. The same noun is sometimes masculine <i>and</i> feminine, and
sometimes masculine <i>or</i> feminine. The noun <i>parents</i> is of the
masculine <i>and</i> feminine gender. The nouns <i>parent, associate,
neighbor, servant, friend, child, bird, fish, &amp;c.</i> if doubtful, are
of the masculine <i>or</i> feminine gender.</div>

<div class="smalltext">2. Some nouns naturally neuter, are, when used figuratively, or
<i>personified</i>, converted into the masculine or feminine gender.
Those nouns are generally rendered masculine, which are conspicuous
for the attributes of imparting or communicating, and which are by
nature strong and efficacious; as, the <i>sun, time, death, sleep,</i>
<i>winter, &amp;c.</i> Those, again, are generally feminine, which are
conspicuous for the attributes of containing or bringing forth, or
which are very beautiful, mild, or amiable; as, the <i>earth, moon,</i>
<i>church, boat, vessel, city, country, nature, ship, soul, fortune,</i>
<i>virtue, hope, spring, peace, &amp;c.</i> This principle for designating the
sex of a personified object, which is quite rational, is generally
adhered to in the English language; but, in some instances, the poet
applies the sex according to his fancy.</div>

<div class="smalltext">The masculine and feminine genders are distinguished in three ways:</div>

<h3><a name="PERSON"></a>PERSON.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">PERSON is a property of the noun and pronoun which varies the verb.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>first person</i> denotes the speaker.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>second person</i> denotes the person or thing spoken to; as, &quot;Listen,
<i>earth!&quot;</i></div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>third person</i> denotes the person or thing spoken of; as, &quot;The
<i>earth</i> thirsts.&quot;</div>

<p>Nouns have but <i>two</i> persons, the second and third. When a man speaks,
the <i>pronoun I</i> or <i>we</i> is always used; therefore nouns can never be in
the <i>first</i> person. In examples like the following, some philologists
suppose the noun to be in the <i>first</i> person:&mdash;&quot;This may certify, that
I, <i>Jonas Taylor</i>, do hereby give and grant,&quot; &amp;c. But it is evident,
that the speaker or writer, in introducing his own name, speaks <i>of</i>
himself; consequently the noun is of the <i>third person</i>.</p>

<p>If you wish to understand the persons of nouns, a little sober thought
is requisite; and, by exercising it, all difficulties will be removed.
If I say, my <i>son</i>, have you seen the young man? you perceive that the
noun <i>son</i> is of the <i>second</i> person, because I address myself <i>to</i> him;
that is, he is spoken <i>to;</i> but the noun <i>man</i> is of the <i>third</i>
person, because he is spoken <i>of</i>. Again, if I say, young <i>man</i>, have
you seen my son? <i>man</i> is of the <i>second</i> person, and <i>son</i> is of the
<i>third</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Hast thou left thy blue course in the heavens, golden-haired <i>sun</i> of
the sky?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Father</i>, may the Great Spirit so brighten the chain of friendship
between us, that a child may find it, when the sun is asleep in his
wig-wam behind the western waters.&quot;</p>

<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>&quot;Lo, earth receives him from the bending skies!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>Sink down, ye <i>mountains</i>, and, ye <i>valleys</i>, rise!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>&quot;Eternal <i>Hope</i>, thy glittering wings explore</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>Earth's loneliest bounds, and ocean's wildest shore.&quot;</span><br />

<a name="nominative_case_independent_1"></a>
<p>In these examples, the nouns, sun, father, mountains, valleys, and hope,
are of the <i>second</i> person, and, as you will hereafter learn, in the
nominative case independent. Course, heavens, sky, Spirit, chain,
friendship, child, sun, wig-wam, waters, earth, skies, wings, earth,
bounds, ocean, and shore, are all of the <i>third</i> person.</p>

<h3><a name="NUMBER"></a>NUMBER.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">Number is the distinction of objects, as one or more. Nouns are of two
numbers, the singular and the plural.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>singular</i> number implies but one; as, a <i>book</i>.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>plural</i> number implies more than one; as, <i>books</i>.</div>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">1. Some nouns are used only in the singular form; as, hemp, flax,
barley, wheat, pitch, gold, sloth, pride, honesty, meekness,
compassion, &amp;c.; others only in the plural form; as, bellows,
scissors, ashes, riches, snuffers, tongs, thanks, wages, embers,
ides, pains, vespers, &amp;c.</div>

<div class="smalltext">2. Some words are the same in both numbers; as, deer, sheep, swine;
and, also, hiatus, apparatus, series, species.</div>

<div class="smalltext">3. The plural number of nouns is generally formed by adding <i>s</i> to
the singular; as, dove, doves; face, faces; but sometimes we add
<i>es</i> in the plural; as, box, boxes; church, churches; lash, lashes;
cargo, cargoes.</div>

<div class="smalltext">4. Nouns ending in <i>f</i> or <i>fe</i>, are rendered plural by a change of
that termination into <i>ves</i>; as, half, halves; wife, wives: except
grief, relief, reproof, and several others, which form their plurals
by the addition of <i>s</i>. Those ending in <i>ff</i>, have the regular
plural; as, ruff, ruffs; except staff, staves.</div>

<div class="smalltext">5. Nouns ending in <i>y</i> in the singular, with no other vowel in the
same syllable, change it into <i>ies</i> in the plural; as, beauty,
beauties; fly, flies. But the <i>y</i> is not changed, where there is
another vowel in the syllable; as, key, keys; delay, delays;
attorney, attorneys; valley, valleys; chimney, chimneys.</div>

<div class="smalltext">6. <i>Mathematics, metaphysics, politics, optics, ethics, pneumatics,</i>
<i>hydraulics</i>, &amp;c. are construed either as singular or plural nouns.</div>

<div class="smalltext">7. The word <i>news</i> is always singular. The nouns <i>means, alms</i>, and
<i>amends</i>, though plural in form, may be either singular or plural in
signification. Antipodes, credenda, literati, and minuti&aelig; are
always plural. <i>Bandit</i> is now used as the singular of Banditti.</div>

<div class="smalltext">8. The following nouns form their plurals not according to any
general rule; thus, man, men; woman, women; child, children; ox,
oxen; tooth, teeth; goose, geese; foot, feet; mouse, mice; louse,
lice; brother, brothers or brethren; cow, cows or kine; penny,
pence, or pennies when the coin is meant; die, dice <i>for play,</i>
dies <i>for coining;</i> pea and fish, pease and fish when the species
is meant, but <i>peas</i> and <i>fishes</i> when we refer to the number; as,
six <i>peas</i>, ten <i>fishes</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext">9. The following compounds form their plurals thus: handful,
handfuls; cupful, cupfuls; spoonful, spoonfuls:&mdash;brother-in-law,
brothers-in-law; court-martial, courts-martial.</div>

<div class="smalltext">The following words form their plurals according to the rules of the
languages from which they are adopted.</div>

<h3><a name='CASE'></a>CASE.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">Case, when applied to nouns and pronouns, means the different state,
situation, or position they have in relation to other words. Nouns have
three cases, the nominative, the possessive, and the objective.</div>

<p>I deem the essential qualities of <i>case</i>, in English, to consist, not in
the <i>changes</i> or <i>inflections</i> produced on nouns and pronouns, but in
the various offices which they perform in a sentence, by assuming
different positions in regard to other words. In accordance with this
definition, these cases can be easily explained on reasoning
principles, founded in the nature of things.</p>

<p>Now, five grains of common sense will enable any one to comprehend what
is meant by case. Its real character is extremely simple; but in the
different grammars it assumes as many meanings as Proteus had shapes.
The most that has been written on it, however, is mere verbiage. What,
then, is meant by <i>case</i>? In speaking of a horse, for instance, we say
he is in a good <i>case</i>, when he is fat, and in a bad <i>case</i>, when he is
lean, and needs more oats; and in this sense we apply the term <i>case</i> to
denote the <i>state</i> or <i>condition</i> of the horse. So, when we place a noun
before a verb as actor or subject, we say it is in the <i>nominative
case</i>; but when it follows a transitive verb or preposition, we say it
has another <i>case</i>; that is, it assumes a new <i>position</i> or <i>situation</i>
in the sentence: and this we call the <i>objective</i> case. Thus, the <i>boy</i>
gathers fruit. Here the boy is represented as <i>acting</i>. He is,
therefore, in the <i>nominative</i> case. But when I say, Jane struck the
<i>boy</i>, I do not represent the boy as the <i>actor</i>, but as the <i>object</i> of
the action. He is, therefore, in a new <i>case</i> or <i>condition</i>. And when I
say, This is the <i>boy's</i> hat, I do not speak of the boy either as
<i>acting</i> or as <i>acted upon</i>; but as possessing something: for which
reason he is in the <i>possessive</i> case. Hence, it is clear, that nouns
have three cases or positions.</p>

<p>As the nominative and objective cases of the noun are inseparably
connected with the verb, it is impossible for you to understand them
until you shall have acquired some knowledge of this part of speech. I
will, therefore, now give you a partial description of the verb in
connexion with the noun; which will enable me to illustrate the cases of
the noun so clearly, that you may easily comprehend their nature.</p>

<p>In the formation of language, mankind, in order to hold converse with
each other, found it necessary, in the first place, to give <i>names</i> to
the various objects by which they were surrounded. Hence the origin of
the first part of speech, which we denominate the <i>noun</i>. But merely to
name the objects which they beheld or thought of, was not sufficient for
their purpose. They perceived that these objects existed, moved, acted,
or caused some action to be done. In looking at a man, for instance,
they perceived that he lived, walked, ate, smiled, talked, ran, and so
on. They perceived that plants grow, flowers bloom, and rivers flow.
Hence the necessity of another part of speech, whose office it should be
to express these existences and actions. This second class of words we
call</p>

<h3><a name="VERBS_i"></a>VERBS.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">A verb is a word which signifies to BE, to DO, or to SUFFER; as, I <i>am</i>;
I <i>rule</i>; I <i>am ruled</i>.</div>

<div class="bigtext">Verbs are of three kinds, active, passive, and neuter. They are also
divided into regular, irregular, and defective.</div>

<p>The term <i>verb</i> is derived from the Latin word <i>verbum</i>, which signifies
a <i>word</i>. This part of speech is called a <i>verb</i> or <i>word</i>, because it
is deemed the most important word in every sentence: and without a verb
and nominative, either expressed or implied, no sentence can exist. The
noun is the original and leading part of speech; the verb comes next in
order, and is far more complex than the noun. These two are the most
useful in the language, and form the basis of the science of grammar.
The other eight parts of speech are subordinate to these two, and, as
you will hereafter learn, of minor importance.</p>

<p>For all practical purposes, the foregoing definition and division of the
verb, though, perhaps, not philosophically correct, will be found as
<i>convenient</i> as any other. I adopt them, therefore, to be consistent
with the principle, that, in arranging the materials of this treatise, I
shall not alter or reject any established definition, rule, or principle
of grammar, unless, in my humble judgment, some <i>practical advantage</i> to
the learner is thereby gained. The following, some consider a good
definition.</p>

<div class="bigtext">A VERB is a word which <i>expresses affirmation</i>.</div>

<a name='nominative_i'></a>
<div class="bigtext">An <i>active verb</i> expresses action; and<br />
The <i>nominative case</i> is the actor, or subject of the verb; as, <i>John
writes</i>.</div>

<p>In this example, which is the <i>verb?</i> You know it is the word <i>writes</i>,
because this word signifies to <i>do;</i> that is, it expresses <i>action</i>,
therefore, according to the definition, it is an <i>active verb</i>. And you
know, too, that the noun <i>John</i> is the <i>actor</i>, therefore John is in the
<i>nominative case</i> to the verb writes. In the expressions, The man
walks&mdash;The boy plays&mdash;Thunders roll&mdash;- Warriors fight&mdash;you perceive that
the words <i>walks, plays, roll</i>, and <i>fight</i>, are <i>active verbs;</i> and you
cannot be at a loss to know, that the nouns <i>man, boy, thunders</i>, and
<i>warriors</i>, are in the <i>nominative case.</i></p>

<p>As no <i>action</i> can be produced without some agent or moving cause, it
follows, that every active verb must have some <i>actor</i> or <i>agent</i>. This
<i>actor, doer</i>, or <i>producer of the action</i>, is the nominative.
<i>Nominative</i>, from the Latin <i>nomino</i>, literally signifies to <i>name;</i>
but in the technical sense in which it is used in grammar, it means the
noun or pronoun which is the <i>subject</i> of affirmation. This subject or
nominative may be <i>active, passive</i>, or <i>neuter</i>, as hereafter
exemplified.</p>

<div class="bigtext">A <i><a name="neuter_verb"></a>neuter verb</i> expresses neither action nor passion, but <i>being</i>, or <i>a
state of being</i>; as, <i>John sits</i>.</div>

<p>Now, in this example, <i>John</i> is not represented as <i>an actor</i>, but, as
the <i>subject</i> of the verb <i>sits</i>, therefore John is in the <i>nominative
case</i> to the verb. And you know that the word <i>sits</i> does not express
<i>apparent action</i>, but a <i>condition of being;</i> that is, it represents
John in a particular <i>state of existence;</i> therefore <i>sits</i> is a <i>neuter
verb</i>. In speaking of the neuter gender of nouns, I informed you, that
<i>neuter</i> means <i>neither;</i> from which it follows, that neuter gender
implies neither gender; that is, neither masculine nor feminine. Hence,
by an easy transition of thought, you learn, that <i>neuter</i>, when applied
to verbs, means neither of the other two classes; that is, a <i>neuter</i>
verb is one which is neither active nor passive. In these examples, The
man stands&mdash;The lady lives&mdash;The child sleeps&mdash;The world exists&mdash;the
words <i>stands, lives, sleeps</i>, and <i>exists</i>, are <i>neuter verbs;</i> and the
nouns, <i>man, lady, child</i>, and <i>world</i>, are all in the <i>nominative
case</i>, because each is the <i>subject</i> of a verb. Thus you perceive, that
when a noun is in the nominative case to an <i>active</i> verb, it is the
<i>actor;</i> and when it is nominative to a <i>neuter</i> verb, it is <i>not</i> an
actor, but the <i>subject</i> of the verb.</p>

<p>Some neuter verbs express <i>being in general;</i> as, The man <i>is</i>; Kingdoms
<i>exist</i>. Others express <i>being in some particular state</i>; as, The man
<i>stands, sits, lies</i>, or <i>hangs</i>.</p>

<p>I will now give you two <i>signs</i>, which will enable you to distinguish
the verb from other parts of speech, when you cannot tell it by its
signification. Any word that will make sense with <i>to</i> before it, is a
verb. Thus, to run, to write, to smile, to sing, to hear, to ponder, to
live, to breathe, are verbs. Or, any word that will <i>conjugate</i>, is a
verb. Thus, I run, thou runnest, he runs; I write, thou writest, he
writes; I smile, &amp;c. But the words, boy, lady, child, and world, will
not make sense with <i>to</i> prefixed&mdash;<i>to</i> boy, <i>to</i> lady, <i>to</i> world, is
nonsense. Neither will they con<i>jugate</i>&mdash;I lady, thou ladiest, &amp;c. is
worse than nonsense. Hence you perceive, that these words are <i>not</i>
verbs. There are some exceptions to these rules, for verbs are sometimes
used as nouns. This will be explained by and by.</p>

<div class="bigtext">To verbs belong <i>number, person, mood</i>, and <i>tense</i>.</div>

<p>At present I shall speak only of the number and person of verbs; but
hereafter I will give you a full explanation of all their properties.
And permit me to inform you, that I shall not lead you into the
<i>intricacies</i> of the science, until, by gradual and easy progressions,
you are enabled to comprehend the principles involved in them. Only such
principles will be elucidated, as you are prepared to understand at the
time they are unfolded before you. You must not be too anxious to get
along <i>rapidly</i>; but endeavor to become thoroughly acquainted with one
principle, before you undertake another. This lecture will qualify you
for the next.</p>

<p>NUMBER AND PERSON OF VERBS. You recollect, that the nominative is the
<i>actor</i> or <i>subject</i>, and the active verb is the <i>action</i> performed by
the nominative. By this you perceive, that a very intimate connexion or
relation exists between the nominative case and the verb. If, therefore,
only <i>one</i> creature or thing acts, only <i>one</i> action, at the same
instant, can be done; as, The <i>girl writes</i>. The nominative <i>girl</i> is
here of the singular number, because it signifies but one person; and
the verb <i>writes</i> denotes but one action, which the girl performs;
therefore the verb <i>writes</i> is of the <i>singular</i> number, agreeing with
its nominative <i>girl</i>. When the nominative case is <i>plural</i>, the verb
must be <i>plural</i>; as, <i>girls write</i>. Take notice, the <i>singular</i> verb
ends in <i>s</i>, but the noun is generally <i>plural</i> when it ends in <i>s</i>;
thus, The girl <i>writes</i>&mdash;the <i>girls</i> write.</p>

<p><i>Person</i>, strictly speaking, is a quality that belongs <i>not</i> to <i>verbs</i>,
but to nouns and pronouns. We say, however, that the verb must agree
with its nominative in <i>person</i>, as well as in number; that is, the verb
must be spelled and spoken in such a manner as to correspond with the
<i>first, second</i>, or <i>third</i> person of the noun or pronoun which is its
nominative.</p>

<p>I will now show you how the verb is varied in order to agree with its
nominative in number and person. I, Thou, He, She, It; We, Ye or You,
They, are <i>personal pronouns</i>. <i>I</i> is of the <i>first</i> person, and
<i>singular</i> number; <i>Thou</i> is <i>second</i> person, <i>sing.</i>; <i>He, She</i>, or
<i>It</i>, is <i>third</i> per. <i>sing.</i>; <i>We</i> is <i>first</i> per. <i>plural</i>; <i>Ye</i> or
<i>You</i> is <i>second</i> per. <i>plural</i>; <i>They</i> is <i>third</i> per. <i>plural</i>. These
pronouns are the representatives of nouns, and perform the same office
that the nouns would for which they stand. When placed before the verb,
they are, therefore, the <i>nominatives</i> to the verb.</p>

<p>Notice particularly, the different variations or endings of the verb, as
it is thus conjugated in the</p>

<h4>INDICATIVE MOOD, PRESENT TENSE.</h4>


<table align='center' border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' summary=''>
<tr><td align='center'><i>Singular</i>.</td><td align='center'><i>Plural</i>.</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>1. <i>Per</i>. I walk,</td><td align='left'>1. <i>Per</i>. We Walk,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>2. <i>Per</i>. Thou walk<i>est</i>,</td><td align='left'>2. <i>Per</i>. Ye <i>or</i> you walk,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>3. <i>Per</i>. He walk<i>s</i>, <i>or</i> the boy walk<i>s</i>, <i>or</i> walk<i>eth</i>.</td><td align='left'> 3. <i>Per</i>. They walk, or the boys walk.</td></tr>
</table>



<p>This display of the verb shows you, that whenever it ends in <i>est</i>, it
is of the <i>second</i> person <i>singular</i>; but when the verb ends in <i>s</i>, or
<i>eth</i>, it is of the <i>third</i> person singular. <i>Walkest, ridest,
standest</i>, are of the second person singular; and <i>walks</i> or <i>walketh,
rides</i> or <i>rideth, stands</i> or <i>standeth</i>, are of the third person
singular.</p>

<p>I have told you, that when the nominative is singular number, the verb
must be; when the nominative is plural, the verb must be; and when the
nominative is first, second, or third person, the verb must be of the
same person. If you look again at the foregoing conjugation of <i>walk</i>,
you will notice that the verb varies if its endings in the <i>singular</i>,
in order to agree in <i>form</i> with the first, second, and third person of
its nominative; but in the <i>plural</i> it does not vary its endings from
the first person singular. The verb, however, agrees in <i>sense</i> with its
nominative in the plural, as well as in the singular. Exercise a little
mind, and you will perceive that <i>agreement</i> and <i>government</i> in
language do not consist <i>merely</i> in the <i>form</i> of words. Now, is it not
clear, that when I say, I <i>walk</i>, the verb walk is <i>singular</i>, because
it expresses but <i>one</i> action? And when I say, Two men <i>walk</i>, is it not
equally apparent, that walk is <i>plural</i>, because it expresses <i>two</i>
actions? In the sentence, Ten men <i>walk</i>, the verb <i>walk</i> denotes <i>ten</i>
actions, for there are ten actors. Common sense teaches you, that there
must be as many <i>actions</i> as there are <i>actors</i>; and that the verb, when
it has <i>no form</i> or <i>ending</i> to show it, is as strictly plural, as when
it has.&mdash;So, in the phrase, <i>We</i> walk, the verb walk is <i>first</i> person,
because it expresses the actions performed by the <i>speakers: Ye</i> or
<i>you</i> walk, the verb is <i>second</i> person, denoting the actions of the
persons <i>spoken to;</i> third person, <i>They</i> walk. The verb, then, when
correctly written, always agrees, in <i>sense</i>, with its nominative in
number and person.</p>

<p>At present you are learning two parts of speech, neither of which can be
understood without a knowledge of the other. It therefore becomes
necessary to explain them both, in the same lecture. You have been
already informed, that nouns have three cases; the nominative, the
possessive, and the objective.</p>

<div class="bigtext"><a name="POSSESSIVE"></a>POSSESSIVE CASE. The <i>possessive case</i> denotes the possessor of
something; as, This is <i>John's</i> horse. This expression implies, that
<i>John</i> is the <i>owner</i> or <i>possessor</i> of the horse; and, that horse is
the <i>property</i> which he possesses.</div>

<p>When I say, These are the <i>men's</i>, and those, the <i>boys'</i> hats, the two
words, &quot;boys' hats,&quot; plainly convey the idea, if they have any meaning
at all, that the boys <i>own</i> or <i>possess</i> the hats. &quot;Samuel Badger sells
<i>boys'</i> hats.&quot; Who <i>owns</i> the hats? Mr. Badger. How is that fact
ascertained? Not by the words, &quot;boys' hats,&quot; which, taken by themselves,
imply, not that they are <i>Mr. Badger's</i> hats, nor that they are <i>for</i>
boys, but that they are hats <i>of</i>, or <i>belonging to</i>, or <i>possessed by</i>
boys. But we <i>infer</i> from the <i>words connected</i> with the phrase, &quot;boys'
hats,&quot; that the boys are not yet, as the phrase literally denotes, in
the actual possession of the hats. The possession is anticipated.</p>

<p>In the phrases, <i>fine</i> hats, <i>coarse</i> hats, <i>high-crowned</i> hats,
<i>broad-brimmed</i> hats, <i>woollen, new, ten, some, these, many</i> hats, the
words in italics, are adjectives, because they restrict, qualify, or
define the term <i>hats;</i> but the term <i>boys'</i> does not <i>describe</i> or
limit the meaning of <i>hats. Boys'</i>, therefore, is not, as some suppose,
an adjective.</p>

<p>&quot;The <i>slave's</i> master.&quot; Does the slave possess the master? Yes. The
slave <i>has</i> a master. If he <i>has</i> him, then, he <i>possesses</i> him;&mdash;he
sustains that relation to him which we call possession.</p>

<p>A noun in the possessive case, is always known by its having an
apostrophe, and generally an <i>s</i> after it; thus, <i>John's</i>, hat; the
<i>boy's</i> coat. When a plural noun in the possessive case, ends in <i>s</i>,
the apostrophe is added, but no additional <i>s</i>; as, &quot;<i>Boys'</i> hats;
<i>Eagles'</i> wings.&quot; When a singular noun ends in <i>ss</i>, the apostrophe
only is added; as, &quot;For <i>goodness'</i> sake; for <i>righteousness'</i> sake;&quot;
except the word witness; as, &quot;The <i>witness's</i> testimony.&quot; When a noun in
the possessive case ends in <i>ence</i>, the <i>s</i> is omitted, but the
apostrophe is retained; as, &quot;For <i>conscience'</i> sake.&quot;</p>

<p>Now please to turn back, and read over this and the preceding lecture
<i>three</i> times, and endeavor, not only to understand, but, also, to
<i>remember</i>, what you read. In reading, proceed thus: read one sentence
over slowly, and then look off the book, and repeat it two or three
times over in your mind. After that, take another sentence and proceed
in the same manner, and so on through the whole lecture. Do not presume
to think, that these directions are of no real consequence to you; for,
unless you follow them strictly, you need not expect to make rapid
progress. On the other hand, if you proceed according to my
instructions, you will be sure to acquire a practical knowledge of
grammar in a short time.&mdash;When you shall have complied with this
requisition, you may commit the following <i>order of parsing a noun</i>, and
<i>the order of parsing a verb</i>; and then you will be prepared to parse or
analyze the following examples.</p>

<h4><a name="parsing"></a>ANALYSIS, OR PARSING.</h4>

<p>Do you recollect the meaning of the word <i>analysis?</i> If you do not, I
will explain if: and first, I wish you to remember, that analysis is the
reverse of synthesis. <i>Synthesis</i> is the act of combining simples so as
to form a whole or compound. Thus, in putting together letters so as to
form syllables, syllables so as to form words, words so as to form
sentences, and sentences so as to form a discourse, the process is
called synthetic. <i>Analysis</i>, on the contrary, is the act of
decomposition; that is, the act of separating any thing compounded into
its simple parts, and thereby exhibiting its elementary principles.
Etymology treats of the analysis of language. To analyze a sentence, is
to separate from one another and classify the different words of which
it is composed; and to analyze or <i>parse</i> a word, means to enumerate and
describe all its various properties, and its grammatical relations with
respect to other words in a sentence, and trace it through all its
inflections or changes. Perhaps, to you, this will, at first, appear to
be of little importance; but, if you persevere, you will hereafter find
it of great utility, for parsing will enable you to detect, and correct,
errors in composition.</p>

<h3>SYSTEMATIC ORDER OF PARSING.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>order of parsing</i> a NOUN, is&mdash;a noun, and why?&mdash;common, proper, or
collective, and why?&mdash;gender, and why?&mdash;person, and why?&mdash;number, and
why?&mdash;case, and why?&mdash;RULE:&mdash;decline it.</div>

<div class="bigtext"><i>The order of parsing</i> a VERB, is&mdash;a verb, and why?&mdash;active, passive,
or neuter, and why?&mdash;if <i>active</i>&mdash;transitive or intransitive, and
why?&mdash;if <i>passive</i>&mdash;how is it formed?&mdash;regular, irregular, or defective,
and why?&mdash;mood, and why?&mdash;tense, and why?&mdash;person and number, and
why?&mdash;with what does it agree?&mdash;RULE:&mdash;conjugate it.</div>

<p>I will now parse two nouns according to the order, and, in so doing, by
applying the definitions and rules, I shall answer all those questions
given in the order. If you have <i>perfectly committed</i> the order of
parsing a noun and verb, you may proceed with me; but, recollect, you
cannot parse a verb <i>in full</i>, until you shall have had a more complete
explanation of it.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'><i>John's hand trembles</i>.</p>

<p><i>John's</i> is a noun, [because it is] the name of a person&mdash;proper, the
name of an individual&mdash;masculine gender, it denotes a male&mdash;third
person, spoken of&mdash;singular number, it implies but one&mdash;and in the
possessive case, it denotes possession&mdash;it is governed by the noun
&quot;hand,&quot; according to</p>

<p>RULE 12. <i>A noun or pronoun in the possessive case, is governed by the
noun it possesses</i>.</p>

<p>Declined&mdash;Sing. nom. John, poss. John's, obj. John. Plural&mdash;nom.
Johns, poss. Johns', obj. Johns.</p>

<p><i>Hand</i> is a noun, the name of a thing&mdash;common, the name of a sort or
species of things&mdash;neuter gender, it denotes a thing without sex&mdash;third
person, spoken of&mdash;sing. number, it implies but one&mdash;and in the
nominative case, it is the actor and subject of the verb &quot;trembles,&quot; and
governs it agreeably to</p>

<p>RULE 3. <i>The nominative case governs the verb:</i>&mdash;that is, the nominative
determines the number and person of the verb.</p>

<p>Declined&mdash;Sing. nom. hand, poss. hand's, obj. hand. Plur. nom. hands,
poss. hands', obj. hands.</p>

<p><i>Trembles</i> is a verb, a word which signifies to do&mdash;active, it expresses
action&mdash;third person, singular number, because the nominative &quot;hand&quot; is
with which it agrees, according to</p>

<a name='agreement'></a>
<p>RULE 4. <i>The verb must agree with its nominative in number and person</i>.</p>

<p>You must not say that the verb is of the third person because <i>it is
spoken of</i>. The verb is never spoken of; but it is of the third person,
and singular or plural number, because its nominative is.</p>

<p>Conjugated&mdash;First pers. sing. I tremble, 2 pers. thou tremblest, 3 pers.
he trembles, or, the hand trembles. Plural, 1 pers. we tremble, 2 pers.
ye or you tremble, 3 pers. they or the hands tremble.</p>

<div class="bigtext"><a name="Government"></a>Government, in language, consists in the power which one word has over
another, in causing that other word to be in some <i>particular case,
number, person, mood</i>, or <i>tense</i>.</div>

<p style='text-align: center'>ILLUSTRATION.</p>

<p>RULE 3. <i>The nominative case governs the verb</i>.</p>

<p>If you employ the pronoun <i>I</i>, which is of the <i>first</i> person, singular
number, as the nominative to a verb, the verb must be of the first pers.
sing, thus, I <i>smile</i>; and when your nominative is <i>second</i> pers. sing,
your verb must be; as, thou smil<i>est</i>. Why, in the latter instance, does
the ending of the verb change to <i>est</i>? Because the nominative changes.
And if your nominative is <i>third</i> person, the verb will vary again;
thus, he smiles, the man smiles. How clear it is, then, that <i>the
nominative governs the verb</i>; that is, the nominative has power to
change the <i>form</i> and <i>meaning</i> of the verb, in respect to num. and
person. Government, thus far, is evinced in the <i>form</i> of the words, as
well as in the sense.</p>

<p>RULE 4. <i>The verb must agree with its nominative in number and person</i>.</p>

<p>It is improper to say, thou <i>hear</i>, the men <i>hears</i>. Why improper?
Because <i>hear</i> is <i>first</i> pers. and the nominative <i>thou</i> is <i>second</i>
pers. <i>Hears</i> is singular, and the nom. <i>men</i> is <i>plural</i>. Rule 4th
says, <i>The verb must agree with its nominative</i>. The expressions should,
therefore, be, thou hear<i>est</i>, the men <i>hear</i>; and then the verb would
<i>agree</i> with its nominatives. But <i>why</i> must the verb agree with its
nominative? Why must we say, thou talk<i>est</i>, the man talks, men <i>talk</i>?
Because the genius of our language, and the common consent of those who
speak it, <i>require</i> such a construction: and this <i>requisition</i> amounts
to a <i>law</i> or <i>rule</i>. This <i>rule</i>, then, is founded in <i>the nature of
things</i>, and sanctioned by <i>good usage</i>.</p>

<p>RULE 12. <i>A noun or pronoun in the possessive case, is governed by the
noun which it possesses</i>.</p>

<p>It is correct to say, The <i>man</i> eats, <i>he</i> eats; but we cannot say, the
<i>man</i> dog eats, <i>he</i> dog eats. Why not? Because the man is here
represented as the <i>possessor</i>, and <i>dog</i>, the <i>property</i>, or <i>thing
possessed</i>; and the genius of our language requires, that when we add to
the possessor, the <i>thing</i> which he is represented as possessing, the
possessor shall take a particular form to show its <i>case</i>, or <i>relation
to the property</i>; thus, The <i>man's</i> dog eats, <i>his</i> dog eats. You
perceive, then, that the <i>added</i> noun, denoting the thing possessed, has
power <i>to change the form</i> of the noun or pronoun denoting the
possessor, according to RULE 12. thus, by adding dog in the preceding
examples, <i>man</i> is changed to <i>man's</i>, and <i>he</i>, to <i>his</i>.</p>

<p>Now parse the sentence which I have parsed, until the manner is quite
familiar to you; and then you will be prepared to analyze correctly and
<i>systematically</i>, the following exercises. When you parse, you may
spread the Compendium before you; and, if you have not already committed
the definitions and rules, you may read them on that, as you apply them.
This mode of procedure will enable you to learn <i>all</i> the definitions
and rules by applying them to practice.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<p>Rain descends&mdash;Rains descend&mdash;Snow falls&mdash;Snows fall&mdash;Thunder
rolls&mdash;Thunders roll&mdash;Man's works decay&mdash;Men's labors cease&mdash;John's dog
barks&mdash;Eliza's voice trembles&mdash;Julia's sister's child improves&mdash;Peter's
cousin's horse limps.</p>

<p>In the next place, I will parse a noun and a <i>neuter</i> verb, which verb,
you will notice, differs from an active only in one respect.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'><i>&quot;Birds repose</i> on the branches of trees.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Birds</i> is a noun, the name of a thing or creature&mdash;common, the name of
a genus or class&mdash;masculine and feminine gender, it denotes both males
and females&mdash;third person, spoken of&mdash;plural number, it implies more
than one&mdash;and in the nominative case, it is the <i>subject</i> of the verb
&quot;repose,&quot; and governs it according to RULE 3. <i>The nominative case
governs the verb</i>. Declined&mdash;Sing. nom. bird, poss. bird's, obj. bird.
Plural, nom. birds, poss. birds', obj. birds.</p>

<p><i>Repose</i> is a verb, a word that signifies to <i>be</i>&mdash;neuter, it expresses
neither action nor passion, but a state of being&mdash;third person, plural
number, because the nominative &quot;birds&quot; is with which it agrees,
agreeably to RULE 4. <i>The verb must agree with its nominative in number
and person</i>.</p>

<p>Declined&mdash;1. pers. sing. I repose, 2. pers. thou reposest, 3. pers. he
reposes, or the bird reposes. Plur. 1. pers. we repose, 2. pers. ye or
you repose, 3. pers. they repose, or birds repose.</p>

<p>Now parse those nouns and neuter verbs that are distinguished by
<i>italics</i>, in the following</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<p>The <i>book lies</i> on the desk&mdash;The <i>cloak hangs</i> on the wall&mdash;<i>Man's days
are</i> few&mdash;<i>Cathmor's warriors sleep</i> in death&mdash;<i>Caltho reposes</i> in the
narrow house&mdash;Jocund <i>day stands</i> tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. The
<i>sunbeams rest</i> on the grave where her <i>beauty sleeps</i>.</p>

<p>You may parse these and the preceding exercises, and all that follow,
<i>five or six times over</i>, if you please.</p>

<a name="OBJECTIVE_i"></a>
<h4>OBJECTIVE CASE.&mdash;ACTIVE-TRANSITIVE VERBS.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>objective</i> case expresses the object of an action or of a
relation. It generally follows a transitive verb, a participle, or a
preposition.</div>

<p>A noun is in the objective case when it is the <i>object</i> of something. At
present I shall explain this case only as the object of an <i>action</i>; but
when we shall have advanced as far as to the preposition, I will also
illustrate it as the object of a <i>relation</i>.</p>

<div class="bigtext">An active verb is <i>transitive</i> when the action passes over from the
subject or nominative to an object; as, Richard <i>strikes</i> John.</div>

<p><i>Transitive</i> means <i>passing</i>. In this sentence the action of the verb
<i>strikes</i> is <i>transitive</i>, because it <i>passes over</i> from the nominative
Richard to the object John; and you know that the noun John is in the
<i>objective</i> case, because it is <i>the object of the action</i> expressed by
the active-transitive verb strikes. This matter is very plain. For
example: Gallileo invented the telescope. Now it is evident, that
Gallileo did not exert his powers of invention, without some object in
view. In order to ascertain that object, put the question, Gallileo
invented what? The telescope. <i>Telescope</i>, then, is the real object of
the action, denoted by the transitive verb invented; and, therefore,
telescope is in the objective case. If I say, The horse <i>kicks</i> the
servant&mdash;Carpenters <i>build</i> houses&mdash;Ossian <i>wrote</i> poems&mdash;Columbus
<i>discovered</i> America&mdash;you readily perceive, that the verbs <i>kick, build,
wrote</i>, and <i>discovered</i>, express transitive actions; and you cannot be
at a loss to tell which nouns are in the objective case:&mdash;they are
<i>servant, houses, poems</i>, and <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>The nominative and objective cases of nouns are generally known by the
following rule: the nominative <i>does something</i>; the objective <i>has
something done to it</i>. The nominative generally comes <i>before</i> the verb;
and the objective, <i>after</i> it. When I say, George struck the servant,
<i>George</i> is in the nominative, and <i>servant</i> is in the objective case;
but, when I say, The servant struck George, <i>servant</i> is in the
nominative case, and <i>George</i> is in the objective. Thus you perceive,
that <i>Case</i> means the different state or situation of nouns with regard
to other words.</p>

<p>It is sometimes very difficult to tell the case of a noun. I shall,
therefore, take up this subject again, when I come to give you an
explanation of the participle and preposition.</p>

<p>Besides the three cases already explained, nouns are sometimes in the
nominative case <i>independent</i>, sometimes in the nominative case
absolute, sometimes in apposition in the same case, and sometimes in the
nominative or objective case after the neuter to <i>be</i>, or after an
active-intransitive or passive verb. These cases are illustrated in
Lecture X. and in the 21 and 22 rules of Syntax.</p>


<h4><a name="ACTIVE_INTRANSITIVE_VERBS"></a>ACTIVE-INTRANSITIVE VERBS.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">An active verb is <i>transitive</i>, when the action terminates on an object:
but</div>

<div class="bigtext">An active verb is <i>intransitive</i>, when the action does <i>not</i> terminate
on an object; as, John <i>walks</i>.</div>

<p>You perceive that the verb <i>walks</i>, in this example, is <i>intransitive</i>,
because the action does not pass over to an object; that is, the action
is confined to the agent John. The following <i>sign</i> will generally
enable you to distinguish a <i>transitive</i> verb from an <i>intransitive</i>.
Any verb that will make sense with the words <i>a thing</i> or <i>a person</i>,
after it, is <i>transitive</i>. Try these verbs by the sign, <i>love, help,
conquer, reach, subdue, overcome</i>. Thus, you can say, I love <i>a person</i>
or <i>thing</i>&mdash;I can help <i>a person</i> or <i>thing</i>&mdash;and so on. Hence you know
that these verbs are transitive. But an intransitive verb will not make
sense with this sign, which fact will be shown by the following
examples: <i>smile, go, come, play, bark, walk, fly</i>. We cannot say, if we
mean to speak English, I smile a <i>person</i> or <i>thing</i>&mdash;I go <i>a person</i> or
<i>thing</i>:&mdash;hence you perceive that these verbs are not transitive, but
intransitive.</p>

<p>If you reflect upon these examples for a few moments, you will have a
clear conception of the nature of transitive and intransitive verbs.
Before I close this subject, however, it is necessary farther to remark,
that some transitive and intransitive verbs express what is called a
<i>mental</i> or <i>moral</i> action; and others, a <i>corporeal</i> or <i>physical</i>
action. Verbs expressing the different affections or operations of the
mind, denote moral actions; as, Brutus <i>loved</i> his country; James
<i>hates</i> vice; We <i>believe</i> the tale:&mdash;to <i>repent</i>, to <i>relent</i>, to
<i>think</i>, to <i>reflect</i>, to <i>mourn</i>, to <i>muse</i>. Those expressing the
actions produced by matter, denote physical actions; as, The <i>dog hears</i>
the bell; Virgil <i>wrote</i> the Aenead; Columbus <i>discovered</i> America;&mdash;to
<i>see</i>, to <i>feel</i>, to <i>taste</i>, to <i>smell</i>, to <i>run</i>, to <i>talk</i>, to <i>fly</i>,
to <i>strike</i>. In the sentence, Charles <i>resembles</i> his father, the verb
<i>resembles</i> does not appear to express any action at all; yet the
construction of the sentence, and the office which the verb performs,
are such, that we are obliged to parse it as an <i>active-transitive</i>
verb, governing the noun <i>father</i> in the objective case. This you may
easily reconcile in your mind, by reflecting, that the verb has a
<i>direct reference</i> to its object. The following verbs are of this
character: <i>Have, own, retain</i>; as, I <i>have</i> a book.</p>

<a name="active_transitive_ii"></a>
<p>Active <i>in</i>transitive verbs are frequently made <i>transitive</i>. When I
say, The birds <i>fly</i>, the verb <i>fly</i> is <i>in</i>transitive; but when I say,
The boy <i>flies</i> the kite, the verb <i>fly</i> is <i>transitive</i>, and governs
the noun <i>kite</i> in the objective case. Almost any active intransitive
verb, and sometimes even neuter verbs, are used as transitive. The horse
<i>walks</i> rapidly; The boy <i>runs</i> swiftly; My friend <i>lives</i> well; The man
<i>died</i> of a fever. In all these examples the verbs are <i>in</i>transitive;
in the following they are <i>transitive</i>: The man <i>walks</i> his horse; The
boy <i>ran</i> a race; My friend <i>lives</i> a holy life; Let me <i>die</i> the death
of the righteous.</p>

<p>The foregoing development of the character of verbs, is deemed
sufficiently critical for practical purposes; but if we dip a little
deeper into the verbal fountain, we shall discover qualities which do
not appear on its surface. If we throw aside the veil which art has
drawn over the real structure of speech, we shall find, that almost
every verb has either a <i>personal</i> or a <i>verbal</i> object, expressed or
implied. Verbal objects, which are the <i>effects</i> or <i>productions</i>
resulting from the actions, being necessarily implied, are seldom
expressed.</p>

<p>The fire <i>burns</i>. If the fire burns, it must burn <i>wood, coal, tallow</i>,
or some other combustible substance. The man <i>laughs</i>. Laughs what?
Laughs <i>laughter</i> or <i>laugh</i>. They <i>walk</i>; that is, They walk or take
<i>walks</i>. Rivers flow (move or roll <i>them-selves</i> or their <i>waters</i>)
into the ocean.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;I <i>sing</i> the shady <i>regions</i> of the west.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;And <i>smile</i> the <i>wrinkles</i> from the brow of age.&quot;</p>

<p>The child <i>wept itself</i> sick; and then, by taking (or <i>sleeping</i>) a
short <i>nap</i>, it <i>slept itself</i> quiet and well again. &quot;He will soon
<i>sleep</i> his everlasting <i>sleep&quot;</i>; that is, &quot;He will <i>sleep</i> the <i>sleep</i>
of death.&quot;</p>

<p>Thinkers think <i>thoughts</i>; Talkers talk or employ <i>words, talk,</i> or
<i>speeches</i>; The rain rains <i>rain</i>. &quot;Upon Sodom and Gomorrah the Lord
<i>rained fire</i> and <i>brimstone</i>.&quot; &quot;I must <i>go</i> the whole <i>length</i>.&quot; &quot;I
shall soon <i>go</i> the <i>way</i> of all the earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Now please to turn back again, and peruse this lecture attentively;
after which you may parse, systematically, the following exercises
containing nouns in the three cases, and active-transitive verbs.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>The printer <i>prints</i> books.</p>

<p><i>Prints</i> is a verb, a word that signifies to do&mdash;active, it expresses
action&mdash;transitive, the action passes over from the nominative &quot;printer&quot;
to the object &quot;books&quot;&mdash;third pers. sing. numb. because the nominative
printer is with which it agrees.</p>

<p>RULE 4. <i>The verb must agree with its nominative case in number and
person</i>.</p>

<p>Declined&mdash;1. pers. sing. I print, 2. pers. thou printest, 3. pers. he
prints, or the printer prints, and so on.</p>

<p><i>Books</i> is a noun, the name of a thing&mdash;common, the name of a sort of
things,&mdash;neut. gend. it denotes a thing without sex&mdash;third pers. spoken
of&mdash;plur. num. it implies more than one&mdash;and in the objective case, it
is the object of the action, expressed by the active-transitive verb
&quot;prints,&quot; and is governed by it according to</p>

<p>RULE 20. <i>Active-transitive verbs govern the objective case</i>.</p>

<p>The noun <i>books</i> is thus declined&mdash;Sing. nom. book, poss. book's, obj.
book&mdash;Plur. nom. books, poss. books', obj. books.</p>

<p>RULE 20. Transitive verbs <i>govern</i> the objective case; that is, they
<i>require</i> the noun or pronoun following them to be in that case; and
this requisition is government. Pronouns have a particular <i>form</i> to
suit each case; but nouns have not. We cannot say, She <i>struck he</i>; I
gave the book <i>to they</i>. Why not? Because the genius of our language
requires the pronoun following a transitive verb or preposition (<i>to</i> is
a preposition) to assume that <i>form</i> which we call the <i>objective</i> form
or case. Accordingly, the construction should be, She struck <i>him</i>; I
gave the book to <i>them</i>.&mdash;Read, again, the illustration of &quot;government&quot;
on page 52.</p>

<p>As you have been analyzing nouns in their three cases, it becomes
necessary to present, in the next place, the declension of nouns, for
you must decline every noun you parse. <i>Declension</i> means putting a noun

case varies from the nominative in its termination, or ending, but the
<i>objective</i> case ends like the nominative. The nominative and objective
cases of nouns, must, therefore, be ascertained by their situation in
the sentence, or by considering the office they perform.</p>

<p>Now, if you have parsed every word in the preceding examples, (except
<i>the, that, those</i>, and <i>his</i>) you may proceed with me and parse the
examples in the following exercises, in which are presented nouns and
active-intransitive verbs.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;My <i>flock increases</i> yearly.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Flock</i> is a noun, a name denoting animals&mdash;a noun of multitude, it
signifies many in one collective body&mdash;masculine and feminine gender,
denoting both sexes&mdash;third person, spoken of&mdash;singular number, it
denotes but one flock&mdash;and in the nominative case, it is the active
agent of the verb &quot;increases,&quot; and governs it, according to RULE 3, <i>The
nominative case governs the verb</i>. (Decline it.)</p>

<p><i>Increases</i> is a verb, a word that signifies to do&mdash;active, it expresses
action&mdash;intransitive, the action does not pass over to an object&mdash;of the
third person, singular number, because its nominative &quot;flock&quot; conveys
<i>unity</i> of idea, and it agrees with &quot;flock&quot; agreeably to</p>

<p>RULE 10. <i>A noun of multitude conveying</i> unity <i>of idea, must have a
verb or pronoun agreeing with it in the singular</i>.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;The divided <i>multitude</i> hastily <i>disperse</i>.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Multitude</i> is a noun, a name that denotes persons&mdash;a collective noun,
or noun of multitude, it signifies many&mdash;masculine and feminine gender,
it implies both sexes&mdash;third person, spoken of&mdash;singular number, it
represents but one multitude, or collective body; (but in another sense,
it is plural, as it conveys plurality of idea, and, also, implies more
<i>individuals</i> than one;)&mdash;and in the nominative case, it is the actor
and subject of the verb &quot;disperse,&quot; which it governs, according to RULE
3. <i>The nom. case governs the verb</i>.&mdash;Declined.&mdash;Sing. nom. multitude,
poss. multitude's, obj. multitude&mdash;Plur. nom. multitudes, poss.
multitudes', obj. multitudes.</p>

<p><i>Disperse</i> is a verb, a word that signifies to do&mdash;active, it expresses
action&mdash;intransitive, the action does not terminate on an object&mdash;third
person, plural number, because its nominative &quot;multitude&quot; conveys
plurality of idea; and it agrees with &quot;multitude&quot; agreeably to RULE 11.
<i>A noun of multitude conveying plurality of idea, must have a verb or
pronoun agreeing with it in the plural.</i></p>

<p>Rules 10, and 11, rest on a sandy foundation. They appear not to be
based on the principles of the language; and, therefore, it might,
perhaps, be better to reject than to retain them. Their application is
quite limited. In many instances, they will not apply to nouns of
multitude. The existence of such a thing as &quot;unity or plurality of
idea,&quot; as applicable to nouns of this class, is <i>doubtful</i>. It is just
as correct to say, &quot;The <i>meeting was</i> divided in <i>its</i> sentiments,&quot; as
to say, &quot;The <i>meeting were</i> divided in <i>their</i> sentiments.&quot; Both are
equally supported by the genius of the language, and by the power of
custom. It is correct to say, either that, &quot;The <i>fleet were</i> dispersed;&quot;
&quot;The <i>council were</i> unanimous;&quot; &quot;The <i>council were</i> divided;&quot; or that,
&quot;The <i>fleet was</i> dispersed;&quot; &quot;The <i>council was</i> unanimous;&quot; &quot;The
<i>council was</i> divided.&quot; But, perhaps for the sake of euphony, in some
instances, custom has decided in favor of a singular, and in others, of
a plural construction, connected with words of this class. For example;
custom gives a preference to the constructions, &quot;My <i>people do</i> not
consider;&quot; &quot;The <i>peasantry go</i> barefoot;&quot; &quot;The <i>flock is</i> his object;&quot;
instead of, &quot;<i>My people doth</i> not consider;&quot; &quot;The <i>peasantry goes</i>
barefoot;&quot; &quot;The <i>flock are</i> his object.&quot; In instances like these, the
application of the foregoing rules <i>may</i> be of some use; but the
constructions in which they do not apply, are probably more numerous
than those in which they do.</p>

<p>Your improvement in grammar depends, not on the number of words which
you parse, but on the <i>attention</i> which you give the subject. <i>You may
parse the same exercises several times over.</i></p>

<p>For the gratification of those who prefer it, I here present another</p>

<h5>DIVISION OF VERBS.</h5>

<p>Verbs are of two kinds, transitive and intransitive.</p>

<p>A verb is transitive when the action affects an object; as, &quot;Earthquakes
<i>rock</i> kingdoms; thrones and palaces <i>are shaken</i> down; and potentates,
princes, and subjects, <i>are buried</i> in one common grave.&quot;</p>

<div class="smalltext">The nominative to a passive verb, is the <i>object</i>, but not the <i>agent</i>,
of the action.</div>

<p>A verb is intransitive when it has no object; as, &quot;The waters <i>came</i>
upon me;&quot; &quot;I <i>am</i> he who <i>was</i>, and <i>is</i>, and <i>is</i> to <i>come</i>.&quot;</p>

<h4>NOTES ON PHILOSOPHICAL GRAMMAR.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">Perhaps no subject has, in this age, elicited more patient research,
and critical investigation of original, constituent principles,
formations, and combinations, than the English language. The
legitimate province of philology, however, as I humbly conceive,
has, in some instances, been made to yield to that of philosophy, so
far as to divert the attention from the combinations of our language
which refinement has introduced, to radical elements and
associations which no way concern the progress of literature, or the
essential use for which language was intended. Were this
retrogressive mode of investigating and applying principles, to
obtain, among philologists, the ascendency over that which
accommodates the use of language to progressive refinement, it is
easy to conceive the state of barbarism to which society would, in a
short time, be reduced. Moreover, if what some call the philosophy
of language, were to supersede, altogether, the province of
philology as it applies to the present, progressive and refined
state of English literature, the great object contemplated by the
learned, in all ages, namely, the approximation of language, in
common with every thing else, to that point of perfection at which
it is the object of correct philology to arrive, would be
frustrated.</div>

<div class="smalltext">The dubious and wildering track struck out by those innovators and
visionaries who absurdly endeavor to teach modern English, by
rejecting the authority and sanction of custom, and by conducting
the learner back to the original combinations, and the detached,
disjointed, and barbarous constructions of our progenitors, both
prudence and reason, as well as a due regard for correct philology,
impel me to shun. Those modest writers who, by bringing to their aid
a little sophistry, much duplicity, and a wholesale traffic in the
swelling phrases, &quot;philosophy, reason, and common sense,&quot; attempt to
overthrow the wisdom of former ages, and show that the result of all
the labors of those distinguished philologists who had previously
occupied the field of grammatical science, is nothing but error and
folly, will doubtless meet the neglect and contempt justly merited
by such consummate vanity and unblushing pedantry. Fortunately for
those who employ our language as their vehicle of mental conference,
custom will not yield to the speculative theories of the visionary.
If it would, improvement in English literature would soon be at an
end, and we should be tamely conducted back to the Vandalic age.</div>

<div class="smalltext">As the use of what is commonly called the philosophy of language, is
evidently misapplied by those who make it the test of <i>grammatical</i>
<i>certainty</i>, it may not be amiss to offer a few considerations with a
view to expose the fallacy of so vague a criterion.</div>

<div class="smalltext">All reasoning and investigation which depend on the philosophy of
language for an ultimate result, must be conducted <i>a posteriori</i>.
Its office, according to the ordinary mode of treating the subject,
is to trace language to its origin, not for the purpose of
determining and fixing grammatical associations and dependances,
such as the agreement, government, and mutual relations of words,
but in order to analyze combinations with a view to develop the
first principles of the language, and arrive at the primitive
meaning of words. Now, it is presumed, that no one who has paid
critical attention to the subject, will contend, that the original
import of single words, has any relation to the syntactical
dependances and connexions of words in general;&mdash;to gain a knowledge
of which, is the leading object of the student in grammar. And,
furthermore, I challenge those who have indulged in such useless
vagaries, to show by what process, with their own systems, they can
communicate a practical knowledge of grammar. I venture to predict,
that, if they make the attempt, they will find their systems more
splendid in theory, than useful in practice.</div>

<div class="smalltext">Again, it cannot rationally be contended, that the radical meaning
has any efficiency in controlling the signification which, by the
power of association, custom has assigned to many words;&mdash;a
signification <i>essentially different</i> from the original import. Were
this the case, and were the language now to be taught and understood
in compliance with the original import of words, it would have to
undergo a thorough change; to be analyzed, divided, and sub-divided,
almost <i>ad infinitum</i>. Indeed, there is the same propriety in
asserting that the Gothic, Danish, and Anglo-Saxon elements in our
language, ought to be pronounced separately, to enable us to
understand our vernacular tongue, that there is in contending, that
their primitive meaning has an ascendency over the influence of the
principle of association in changing, and the power of custom in
determining, the import of words. Many of our words are derived from
the Greek, Roman, French, Spanish, Italian, and German languages;
and the only use we can make of their originals, is to render them
subservient to the force of custom in cases in which general usage
has not varied from the primitive signification. Moreover, let the
advocates of a mere philosophical investigation of the language,
extend their system as far as a radical analysis will warrant them,
and, with Horne Tooke, not only consider adverbs, prepositions,
conjunctions, and interjections, as abbreviations of nouns and
verbs, but, on their own responsibility, apply them, in teaching the
language, <i>in compliance with their radical import</i>, and what would
such a course avail them against the power of custom, and the
influence of association and refinement? Let them show me one
grammarian, produced by such a course of instruction, and they will
exhibit a &quot;philosophical&quot; miracle. They might as well undertake to
teach architecture, by having recourse to its origin, as
represented by booths and tents. In addition to this, when we
consider the great number of obsolete words, from which many now in
use are derived, the original meaning of which cannot be
ascertained, and, also, the multitude whose signification has been
changed by the principle of association, it is preposterous to
think, that a mere philosophical mode of investigating and teaching
the language, is the one by which its significancy can be enforced,
its correctness determined, its use comprehended, and its
improvement extended. Before what commonly passes for a
philosophical manner of developing the language can successfully be
made the medium through which it can be comprehended, in all its
present combinations, relations, and dependances, it must undergo a
thorough retrogressive change, in all those combinations, relations,
and dependances, even to the last letter of the alphabet. And before
we can consent to this radical modification and retrograde ratio of
the English language, we must agree to revive the customs, the
habits, and the precise language of our progenitors, the Goths and
Vandals. Were all the advocates for the introduction of such
philosophical grammars into common schools, at once to enter on
their pilgrimage, and recede into the native obscurity and barbarity
of the ancient Britons, Picts, and Vandals, it is believed, that the
cause of learning and refinement would not suffer greatly by their
loss, and that the good sense of the present age, would not allow
many of our best teachers to be of the party.</div>

<div class="smalltext">The last consideration which I shall give a philosophical manner of
investigating and enforcing the English language, is, that by this
mode of analyzing and reducing it to practice, <i>it cannot, in this</i>
<i>age, be comprehended</i> as the medium of thought. Were this method to
prevail, our present literal language would become a dead letter. Of
what avail is language, if it can not be understood? And how can it
be accommodated to the understanding, unless it receive the sanction
of common consent? Even if we admit that such a manner of unfolding
the principles of our language, is more rational and correct than
the ordinary, practical method, I think it is clear that such a mode
of investigation and development, does not meet the necessities and
convenience of ordinary learners in school. To be consistent, that
system which instructs by tracing a few of our words to their
origin, must unfold the whole in the same manner. But the student in
common schools and academies, cannot afford time to stem the tide of
language up to its source, and there dive to the bottom of the
fountain for knowledge. Such labor ought not to be required of him.
His object is to become, not a philosophical antiquarian, but a
practical grammarian. If I comprehend the design (if they have any)
of our modern philosophical writers on this subject, it is to make
grammarians by inculcating a few general principles, arising out of
the genius of the language, and the nature of things, which the
learner, by the exercise of his <i>reasoning powers</i>, must reduce to
practice. His own judgment, <i>independent of grammar rules</i>, is to be
his guide in speaking and writing correctly. Hence, many of them
exclude from their systems, all exercises in what is called <i>false</i>
<i>Syntax</i>. But these profound philological dictators appear to have
overlooked the important consideration, that the great mass of
mankind, and especially of boys and girls in common schools, <i>can</i>
<i>never become philosophers;</i> and, consequently, can never comprehend
and reduce to practice their metaphysical and obscure systems of
grammar. I wish to see children treated as <i>reasoning</i> beings. But
there should be a medium in all things. It is, therefore, absurd to
instruct children as if they were already profound philosophers and
logicians.</div>

<div class="smalltext">To demonstrate the utility, and enforce the necessity, of exercising
the learner in correcting <i>false Syntax</i>, I need no other argument
than the interesting and undeniable fact, that Mr. Murray's labors,
in this department, have effected a complete revolution in the
English language, in point of verbal accuracy. Who does not know,
that the best writers of this day, are not guilty of <i>one</i>
grammatical inaccuracy, where those authors who wrote before Mr.
Murray flourished, are guilty of <i>five</i>? And what has produced this
important change for the better? Ask the hundreds of thousands who
have studied &quot;Mr. Murray's exercises in FALSE SYNTAX.&quot; If, then,
this view of the subject is correct, it follows, that the greater
portion of our philosophical grammars, are far more worthy the
attention of literary connoisseurs, than of the great mass of
learners.</div>

<div class="smalltext">Knowing that a strong predilection for philosophical grammars,
exists in the minds of some teachers of this science, I have thought
proper, for the gratification of such, to intersperse through the
pages of this work under the head of &quot;PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES,&quot; an
entire system of grammatical principles as deduced from what appears
to me to be the most rational and consistent philosophical
investigations. They who prefer this theory to that exhibited in the
body of the work, are, of course, at liberty to adopt it.</div>

<div class="smalltext"><i>In general, a philosophical theory of grammar will be found to
accord with the practical theory embraced in the body of this work.
Wherever such agreement exists, the system contained in these NOTES
will be deficient, and this deficiency may be supplied by adopting
the principles contained in the other parts of the work</i>.</div>

<a name="derivation_ii"></a>
<h4>OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL CLASSIFICATION OF WORDS.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">According to the method in which philosophical investigations of
language have generally been conducted, all our words should be
reduced to two classes; for it can be easily shown, that from the
noun and verb, all the other parts of speech have sprung. Nay, more.
They may even be reduced to one. Verbs do not, in reality, <i>express</i>
actions; but they are intrinsically the mere <i>names</i> of actions. The
idea of action or being communicated by them, as well as the
<i>meaning</i> of words in general, is merely <i>inferential</i>. The
principle of reasoning assumed by the celebrated Horne Tooke, if
carried to its full extent, would result, it is believed, in proving
that we have but one part of speech.</div>

<a name='adjectives_i'></a>
<div class="smalltext"><i>Adnouns</i> or <i>adjectives</i> were originally nouns. <i>Sweet, red,
white</i>, are the <i>names</i> of qualities, as well as <i>sweetness,
redness, whiteness</i>. The former differ from the latter only in their
<i>manner</i> of signification. To denote that the name of some quality
or substance is to be used in connexion with some other name, or,
that this quality is to be <i>attributed</i> to some other name, we
sometimes affix to it the <a name="terminations_ii"></a>termination <i>en, ed</i>, or <i>y;</i> which
signifies <i>give, add,</i> or <i>join</i>. When we employ the words wood<i>en</i>,
wooll<i>en</i>, wealth<i>y</i>, grass<i>y</i>, the terminations <i>en</i> and <i>y</i>, by
their own intrinsic meaning, give notice that we intend to <i>give,</i>
<i>add, or join</i>, the names of some other substances in which are found
the properties or qualities of <i>wood, wool, wealth</i>, or <i>grass</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext"><i>Pronouns</i> are a class of nouns, used instead of others to prevent
their disagreeable repetition. Participles are certain forms of the
verb. Articles, interjections, adverbs, prepositions, and
conjunctions, are contractions of abbreviations of nouns and verbs.
<i>An</i> (<i>a, one</i>, or <i>one</i>) comes from <i>ananad</i>, to add, to heap.
<i>The</i> and <i>that</i>, from the Anglo-Saxon verb <i>thean</i>, to get, assume.
<i>Lo</i> is the imperative of <i>look</i>; <i>fy</i>, of <i>fian</i>, to hate; and
<i>welcome</i> means, it is <i>well</i> that you are <i>come. In</i> comes from the
Gothic noun <i>inna</i>, the interior of the body; and <i>about</i>, from
<i>boda</i>, the first outward boundary. <i>Through</i> or <i>thorough</i> is the
Teutonic noun <i>thuruh</i>, meaning passage, gate, door. <i>From</i> is the
Anglo-Saxon noun <i>frum</i>, beginning, source, author. He came <i>from
(beginning)</i> Batavia. <i>If</i> (formerly written <i>gif, give, gin</i>) is
the imperative of the Anglo-Saxon verb <i>gifan</i>, to give. I will
remain <i>if</i> (<i>give</i> or <i>grant that fact</i>) he will (<i>remain</i>.) <i>But</i>
comes from the Saxon verb <i>beon-utan</i>, to be-out. I informed no one
<i>but (be-out, leave-out)</i> my brother.</div>

<div class="smalltext">This brief view of the subject, is sufficient to elucidate the
manner in which, according to Horne Tooke's principles, the ten
parts of speech are reduced to one. But I am, by no means, disposed
to concede, that this is the <i>true</i> principle of classification; nor
that it is any more <i>philosophical</i> or <i>rational</i> than one which
allows a more practical division and arrangement of words. What has
been generally received as &quot;philosophical grammar,&quot; appears to
possess no stronger claims to that imposing appellation than our
common, practical grammars. Query. Is not Mr. Murray's octavo
grammar more worthy the dignified title of a &quot;Philosophical
Grammar,&quot; than Horne Tooke's &quot;Diversions of Purley,&quot; or William S.
Cardell's treatises on language? What constitutes a <i>philosophical</i>
treatise, on this, or on any other subject? <i>Wherein</i> is there a
display of philosophy in a speculative, etymological performance,
which attempts to develop and explain the elements and primitive
meaning of words by tracing them to their origin, <i>superior</i> to the
philosophy employed in the development and illustration of the
principles by which we are governed in applying those words to their
legitimate purpose, namely, that of forming a correct and convenient
medium by means of which we can communicate our thoughts? Does
philosophy consist in ransacking the mouldy records of antiquity, in
order to <i>guess</i> at the ancient construction and signification of
single words? or have such investigations, in reality, any thing to
do with <i>grammar</i>?</div>

<div class="smalltext">Admitting that all the words of our language include, in their
<i>original</i> signification, the import of nouns or names, and yet, it
does not follow, that they <i>now</i> possess no other powers, and, in
their combinations and connexions in sentences, are employed for no
other purpose, than <i>barely</i> to <i>name objects</i>. The <i>fact</i> of the
case is, that words are variously combined and applied, to answer
the distinct and diversified purposes of <i>naming</i> objects,
<i>asserting</i> truths, <i>pointing out</i> and <i>limiting</i> objects,
<i>attributing qualities</i> to objects, <i>connecting</i> objects, and so on;
and on this <i>fact</i> is founded the <i>true philosophical principle of
the classification of words</i>. Hence, an arrangement of words into
classes according to this principle, followed by a development and
illustration of the principles and rules that regulate us in the
proper use and application of words in oral and written discourse,
appears to approximate as near to a true definition <i>of</i>
<i>philosophical grammar</i>, as any I am capable of giving.</div>

<div class="smalltext"><i>Nouns</i>, or the names of the objects of our perceptions, doubtless
constituted the original class of words; (if I may be allowed to
assume such a hypothesis as an <i>original</i> class of words;) but the
ever-active principle of association, soon transformed nouns into
verbs, by making them, when employed in a particular manner,
expressive of affirmation. This same principle also operated in
appropriating names to the purpose of attributing qualities to other
names of objects; and in this way was constituted the class of words
called <i>adjectives</i> or <i>attributes</i>. By the same principle were
formed all the other classes.</div>

<div class="smalltext">In the following exposition of English grammar on scientific
principles, I shall divide words into seven classes; <i>Nouns</i> or
<i>Names, Verbs, Adjectives, Adnouns</i>, or <i>Attributes, Adverbs,
Propositions, Pronouns</i>, and <i>Conjunctions</i> or <i>Connectives</i>.</div>

<h4>PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">Plausible arguments may be <i>advanced</i>, for rejecting <i>neuter</i> and
passive verbs; but they have been found to be so convenient in
practice, that the theory which recognises them, has stood the test
of ages. If you tell the young learner, that, in the following
expressions, The church <i>rests</i> on its foundation; The book <i>lies</i>
on the desk; The boys <i>remain (are)</i> idle, the nouns <i>church, book</i>,
and <i>boys</i>, are represented as acting, and, therefore, the verbs
<i>rests, lies, remain</i>, and <i>are</i>, are <i>active</i>, he will not believe
you, because there is no action that is apparent to his senses. And
should you proceed further, and, by a labored and metaphysical
investigation and development of the laws of motion, attempt to
prove to him that &quot;every portion of matter is influenced by
different, active principles, tending to produce change,&quot; and,
therefore, every thing in universal nature is <i>always</i> acting, it is
not at all probable, that you could convince his <i>understanding</i>, in
opposition to the dearer testimony of his senses. Of what avail to
learners is a theory which they cannot comprehend?</div>

<div class="smalltext">Among the various theorists and speculative writers on philosophical
grammar, the ingenious Horne Tooke stands pre-eminent; but,
unfortunately, his principal speculations on the verb, have never
met the public eye. William S. Cardell has also rendered himself
conspicuous in the philological field, by taking a bolder stand than
any of his predecessors. His view of the verb is novel, and
ingeniously supported. The following is the substance of his theory</div>

<h5>OF THE VERB.</h5>

<div class="smalltext">A verb is a word which expresses <i>action;</i> as, Man <i>exists</i>; Trees
<i>grow</i>; Waters<i>flow</i>; Mountains <i>stand</i>; I <i>am</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext">All verbs are active, and have one object or more than one,
expressed or implied. The pillar <i>stands</i>; that is, it <i>keeps
itself</i> in an erect or standing posture; it <i>upholds</i> or <i>sustains
itself</i> in that position. They <i>are</i>; i.e. they <i>air</i> themselves, or
<i>breathe</i> air; they <i>inspirit, vivify</i>, or <i>uphold</i> themselves by
inhaling air.</div>

<div class="smalltext">Many verbs whose objects are seldom expressed, always have a persona
or verbal one implied. The clouds <i>move</i>; i.e. move <i>themselves</i>
along. The troops <i>marched</i> twenty miles a day; i.e. marched
<i>themselves</i>. The moon <i>shines</i>:&mdash;The moon <i>shines</i> or <i>sheds</i> a
<i>shining, sheen, lustre</i>, or <i>brightness</i>. The sparrow
<i>flies:&mdash;flies</i> or <i>takes</i> a <i>flight</i>. Talkers talk or speak <i>words</i>
or <i>talk</i>; Walkers walk <i>walkings</i> or <i>walks</i>; The rain rains
<i>rain</i>; Sitters sit or hold <i>sittings</i> or <i>sessions</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext">To prove that there is no such thing as a neuter verb, the following
appear to be the strongest arguments adduced.</div>

<div class="smalltext">1. No portion of matter is ever in a state of perfect quiescence;
but the component parts of every thing are at all times &quot;influenced
by different, active principles, tending to produce change.&quot; Hence,
it follows, that no being or thing can be represented in a <i>neuter</i>
or <i>non-acting state</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext">This argument supposes the essential character of the verb to be
identified with the primary laws of action, as unfolded by the
principles of physical science. The correctness of this position may
be doubted; but if it can be clearly demonstrated, that every
particle of matter is always in motion, it does not, by any means,
follow, that we cannot <i>speak of</i> things in a state of quiescence.
What is <i>false</i> in fact may be <i>correct</i> in grammar. <i>The point
contested, is not whether things always</i> act, <i>but whether, when we
assert or affirm something respecting them, we always</i> represent
<i>them as acting</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext">2. Verbs were <i>originally</i> used to express the motions or changes of
things which produced obvious actions, and, by an easy transition,
were afterward applied, in the same way, to things whose actions
were not apparent. This assumption is untenable, and altogether
gratuitous.</div>

<div class="smalltext">3. Verbs called neuter are used in the imperative mood; and, as this
mood commands some one to <i>do</i> something, any verb which adopts it,
must be active. Thus, in the common place phrases, &quot;<i>Be</i> there
quickly; <i>Stand</i> out of my way; <i>Sit</i> or <i>lie</i> farther.&quot;</div>

<div class="smalltext">It is admitted that these verbs are here employed in an <i>active</i>
sense; but it is certain, that they are not used according to their
proper, <i>literal</i> meaning. When I tell a man, <i>literally</i>, to
<i>stand, sit</i>, or <i>lie</i>, by <i>moving</i> he would disobey me; but when I
say, &quot;<i>Stand</i> out of my way,&quot; I employ the neuter verb <i>stand</i>,
instead of the active verb <i>move</i> or <i>go</i>, and in a correspondent
sense. My meaning is, <i>Move</i> yourself out of my way; or <i>take</i> your
<i>stand</i> somewhere else. This, however, does not prove that <i>stand</i>
is properly used. If we choose to overstep the bounds of custom, we
can employ any <i>word</i> in the language as an active-transitive verb.
<i>Be, sit</i>, and <i>lie</i>, may be explained in the same manner.</div>

<div class="smalltext">4. Neuter verbs are used in connexion with adverbs which express the
manner of <i>action</i>. They must, therefore, be considered active
verbs. The child <i>sleeps soundly</i>; He <i>sits genteelly</i>; They <i>live
contentedly</i> and <i>happily</i> together.</div>

<div class="smalltext">The class of verbs that are never employed as active, is small. By
using adverbs in connexion with verbs, we can fairly prove that some
verbs are <i>not</i> active. It is incorrect to say, I am <i>happily</i>; They
were <i>peacefully</i>; She remains <i>quietly</i>; The fields appear
<i>greenly</i>. These verbs in their common acceptation, do not express
<i>action</i>; for which reason we say, I am <i>happy</i>; They are
<i>peaceful</i>; &amp;c. But in the expressions, The child sleeps <i>soundly</i>;
She sits <i>gracefully</i>; They live <i>happily</i> and <i>contentedly</i>; we
employ the verbs <i>sleeps, sits</i>, and <i>live</i>, in an active sense.
When no action is intended, we say, They live <i>happy</i> and
<i>contented</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext">If, on scientific principles, it can be proved that those verbs
generally denominated neuter, <i>originally</i> expressed action, their
present, accepted meaning will still oppose the theory, for the
generality of mankind do not attach to them the idea of <i>action</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext">Thus I have endeavored to present a brief but impartial abstract of
the <i>modern</i> theory of the verb, leaving it with the reader to
estimate it according to its value.</div>

<div class="smalltext">To give a satisfactory definition of the <a name="verbs_ii"></a>verb, or such a one as
shall be found scientifically correct and unexceptionable, has
hitherto baffled the skill, and transcended the learning, of our
philosophical writers. If its essential quality, as is generally
supposed, is made to consist in <i>expressing affirmation</i>, it remains
still to be defined <i>when</i> a verb <i>expresses</i> affirmation. In
English, and in other languages, words appropriated to express
affirmation, are often used without any such force; our idea of
affirmation, in such instances, being the mere <i>inference of</i>
<i>custom</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext">In the sentence,&mdash;&quot;<i>Think, love</i>, and <i>hate</i>, denote moral actions,&quot;
the words <i>think, love</i>, and <i>hate</i>, are nouns, because they are
mere <i>names</i> of actions. So, when I say, &quot;John, <i>write</i>&mdash;is an
irregular verb,&quot; the word <i>write</i> is a noun; but when I say, &quot;John,
<i>write</i>&mdash;your copy,&quot; <i>write</i> is called a verb.</div>

<div class="smalltext">Why is this word considered a noun in one construction, and a verb
in the other, when both constructions, until you pass beyond the
word write, are exactly alike? If write does not <i>express</i> action in
the former sentence, neither does it in the latter, for, in both, it
is introduced in the same manner. On scientific principles, <i>write</i>
must be considered a noun in the latter sentence, for it does not
<i>express</i> action, or make an affirmation; but it merely <i>names</i> the
action which I wish John to perform, and affirmation is the
<i>inferential</i> meaning.</div>

<div class="smalltext">The verb in the infinitive, as well as in the imperative mood, is
divested of its affirmative or verbal force. In both these moods, it
is always presented in its <i>noun-state</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext">If, after dinner, I say to a servant, &quot;<i>Wine,&quot;</i> he infers, that I
wish him to bring me wine; but all this is not said. If I say,
<i>Bring</i> some <i>wine</i>, he, in like manner, understands, that I wish
him to bring me wine; but all that is expressed, is the <i>name</i> of
the action, and of the object of the action. In fact, as much is
done by <i>inference</i>, as by actual expression, in every branch of
language, for thought is too quick to be wholly transmitted by
words.</div>

<div class="smalltext">It is generally conceded, that the <a name="terminations_iii"></a>termination of our verbs, <i>est,</i>
<i>eth, s, ed</i>, and, also, of the other parts of speech, were
originally separate words of distinct meaning; and that, although
they have been contracted, and, by the refinement of language, have
been made to coalesce with the words in connexion with which they
are employed, yet, in their present character of terminations, they
retain their primitive meaning and force. To denote that a verbal
name was employed as a verb, the Saxons affixed to it a verbalizing
adjunct; thus, <i>the</i> (to take, hold) was the noun-state of the verb;
and when they used it as a verb, they added the termination <i>an</i>;
thus, the<i>an</i>. The termination added, was a sign that <i>affirmation</i>
was intended. The same procedure has been adopted, and, in many
instances, is still practised, in our language. <i>An</i>, originally
affixed to our verbs, in the progress of refinement, was changed to
en, and finally dropped. A few centuries ago, the plural number of
our verbs was denoted by the termination, <i>en</i>; thus, they <i>weren</i>,
they <i>loven</i>; but, as these terminations do not supersede the
necessity of expressing the <i>subject</i> of affirmation, as is the case
in the Latin and Greek verbs, they have been laid aside, as
unnecessary excrescences. For the same reason, we might, without any
disparagement to the language, dispense with the terminations of our
verbs in the singular.</div>

<div class="smalltext">In support of the position, that these terminations were once
separate words, we can trace many of them to their origin. To denote
the feminine gender of some nouns, we affix <i>ess</i>; as, heir<i>ess</i>,
instructr<i>ess. Ess</i> is a contraction of the Hebrew noun <i>essa</i>, a
female. Of our verbs, the termination <i>est</i> is a contraction of
<i>doest, eth</i>, of <i>doeth</i>, <i>s</i> of <i>does</i>. We say, thou <i>dost</i> or
<i>doest</i> love; or thou <i>lovest</i>; i.e. <i>love-dost</i>, or <i>love-doest</i>.
Some believe these terminations to be contractions of <i>havest,
haveth, has</i>. We affix <i>ed</i>, a contraction of <i>dede</i>, to the present
tense of verbs to denote that the action named is <i>dede, did, doed</i>,
or <i>done</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext"><i><a name="To"></a>To</i> and <i>do</i> from the Gothic noun <i>taui</i>, signifying <i>act</i> or
<i>effect</i>, are, according to Horne Tooke, nearly alike in meaning and
<i>force; and when the custom of affixing some more ancient verbalizing</i>
<i>adjunct, began to be dropped, its place and meaning were generally</i>
supplied by prefixing one of these. When I say, &quot;I am going <i>to
walk,&quot;</i> the verbal or affirmative force is conveyed by the use of
<i>to</i>, meaning the same as <i>do</i>; and <i>walk</i> is employed merely as a
verbal name; that is, I assert that I shall <i>do</i> the act which I
name by the word <i>walk</i>, or the act of <i>walking</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext">Perhaps such speculations as these will prove to be more curious
than profitable. If it be made clearly to appear, that, on
scientific principles, whenever the verbal name is unaccompanied by
a verbalizing adjunct, it is in the <i>noun-state</i>, and does not
express affirmation, still this theory would be very inconvenient in
practice.</div>

<div class="smalltext">I shall resume this subject in Lecture XI.</div>

<h4>QUESTIONS ON THE PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">What has usually been the object of philosophical investigations of
language? (page 32.)&mdash;Do the syntactical dependances and connexions of
words depend on their <i>original</i> import?&mdash;Is the power of association
and custom efficient in changing the radical meaning of some
words?&mdash;Have words intrinsically a signification of their own; or is
their meaning <i>inferential</i>; i.e. such as <i>custom</i> has assigned to them?
(page 38.)&mdash;On what <i>fact</i> is based the true, philosophical principle of
classification?&mdash;Define philosophical grammar.&mdash;Which is supposed to be

<i>noun-state?</i> (page 48.)&mdash;Give examples.&mdash;What is said of the
terminations <i>est, eth, s,</i> and <i>en</i>, and of the words <i>to</i> and <i>do?</i></div>

<h4>REMARKS ON VERBS AND NOUNS.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">You have already been informed, that verbs are the most important part
of speech in our language; and to convince you of their importance, I
now tell you, that you cannot express a <i>thought</i>, or communicate an
<i>idea</i>, without making use of a verb, either expressed or implied. Verbs
express, not only <i>the state</i> or <i>manner of being</i>, but, likewise, all
the different <i>actions</i> and <i>movements</i> of all creatures and things,
whether animate or inanimate. As yet I have given you only a partial
description of this sort of words; but when you are better prepared to
comprehend the subject, I will explain all their properties, and show
you the proper manner of using them.</div>

<div class="smalltext">A word that is generally a <i>noun</i>, sometimes becomes a <i>verb</i>; and a
verb is frequently used as a <i>noun</i>. These changes depend on the sense
which the word conveys; or, rather, on the office it performs in the
sentence; that is the <i>manner</i> in which it is applied to things. For
instance, <i>glory</i> is generally a noun; as &quot;The <i>glory</i> of God's throne.&quot;
But if I say, I <i>glory</i> in religion; or, He <i>glories</i> in wickedness, the
word <i>glory</i> becomes a verb. The <i>love</i> of man is inconstant. In this
sentence, <i>love</i> is a <i>noun</i>; in the next, it is a <i>verb</i>: They <i>love</i>
virtue. He <i>walks</i> swiftly; Scavengers <i>sweep</i> the streets; The ship
<i>sails</i> well. In these phrases, the words <i>walks, sweep</i>, and <i>sails</i>,
are verbs; in the following they are nouns: Those are pleasant <i>walks</i>;
He takes a broad <i>sweep</i>; The ship lowered her <i>sails</i>.</div>

<p>Thus you see, it is impossible for you to become a grammarian without
exercising your judgment. If you have sufficient resolution to do this,
you will, in a short time, perfectly understand the nature and office of
the different parts of speech, their various properties and relations,
and the rules of syntax that apply to them; and, in a few weeks, be able
to speak and write accurately. But you must not take things for granted,
without examining their propriety and correctness. No. You are not a
mere <i>automaton</i>, or <i>boy-machine</i>; but a rational being. You ought,
therefore, to <i>think</i> methodically, to <i>reason</i> soundly, and to
<i>investigate</i> every principle critically. Don't be afraid to <i>think for
yourself</i>. You know not the high destiny that awaits you. You know not
the height to which you may soar in the scale of intellectual existence.
Go on, then, boldly, and with unyielding perseverance; and if you do not
gain admittance into the temple of fame, strive, at all hazards, to
drink of the fountain which gurgles from its base.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>NOTE 1, TO RULE 12. A noun in the possessive case, should always be
distinguished by the apostrophe, or mark of elision; as, The <i>nation's</i>
glory.</p>

<p>That girls book is cleaner than those boys books.</p>

<div class="smalltext">Not correct, because the nouns <i>girls</i> and <i>boys</i> are both in the
possessive case, and, therefore, require the apostrophe, by which they
should be distinguished; thus, &quot;<i>girl's, boys'&quot;</i> according to the
preceding NOTE. [Repeat the note.]</div>

<p>Thy ancestors virtue is not thine.</p>

<div class="smalltext">If the writer of this sentence meant <i>one</i> ancestor, he should have
inserted the apostrophe after <i>r</i>, thus, &quot;<i>ancestor's&quot;</i>; if more than
one, after <i>s</i>, thus, <i>&quot;ancestors'</i> virtue;&quot; but, by neglecting to place
the apostrophe, he has left his meaning ambiguous, and we cannot
ascertain it. This, and a thousand other mistakes you will often meet
with, demonstrate the truth of my declaration, namely, that &quot;without the
knowledge and application of grammar rules, you will often speak and
write in such a manner as not to be <i>understood.&quot;</i> You may now turn back
and re-examine the &quot;illustration&quot; of Rules 3, 4, and 12, on page 52, and
then correct the following examples about <i>five</i> times over.</div>

<p>A mothers tenderness and a fathers care, are natures gift's for mans
advantage. Wisdoms precept's form the good mans interest and happiness.
They suffer for conscience's sake. He is reading Cowpers poems. James
bought Johnsons Dictionary.</p>

<p>RULE 4. A verb must agree with its nominative in number and person.</p>

<p>Those boys improves rapidly. The men labors in the field. Nothing
delight some persons. Thou shuns the light. He dare not do it. They
reads well.</p>

<div class="smalltext">I know you can correct these sentences without a rule, for they all have
a harsh sound, which offends the ear. I wish you, however, to adopt the
habit of correcting errors by applying rules; for, by-and-by, you will
meet with errors in composition which you cannot correct, if you are
ignorant of the application of grammar rules.</div>

<div class="smalltext">Now let us clearly understand this 4th Rule. Recollect, it applies to
the <i>verb</i> and not to the noun; therefore, in these examples the verb is
ungrammatical. The noun <i>boys</i>, in the first sentence, is of the third
person <i>plural</i>, and the verb <i>improves</i> is of the third person
<i>singular</i>; therefore, Rule 4th is violated, because the verb dues not
agree with its nominative in <i>number</i>. It should be, &quot;boys <i>improve</i>.&quot;
The verb would then be <i>plural</i>, and agree with its nominative according
to the Rule. In the fourth sentence, the verb does not agree in <i>person</i>
with its nominative. <i>Thou</i> is of the <i>second</i> person, and <i>shuns</i> is of
the <i>third</i>. It should be, &quot;thou <i>shunnest</i>,&quot; &amp;c. You may correct the
other sentences, and, likewise, the following exercises in</div>

<a name='LECTURE_III'></a><h2>LECTURE III.</h2>
<a name='articles'></a>
<h3>OF ARTICLES.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">An article is a word prefixed to nouns to limit their signification; as,
<i>a</i> man, <i>the</i> woman.</div>

<div class="bigtext"><a name='a_i'></a>There are only two articles, <i>a</i> or <i>an</i>, and <i>the. A</i> or <i>an</i> is called
the indefinite article. <i>The</i> is called the definite article.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>indefinite article</i> limits the noun to one of a kind, but to no
particular one; as, <i>a</i> house.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>definite article</i> generally limits the noun to a particular object,
or collection of objects; as, <i>the</i> house, <i>the</i> men.</div>

<p>The small claims of the article to a separate rank as a distinct part of
speech, ought not to be admitted in a scientific classification of
words. <i>A</i> and <i>the, this</i> and <i>that, ten, few</i>, and <i>fourth</i>, and many
other words, are used to restrict, vary, or define the signification of
the nouns to which they are joined. They might, therefore, with
propriety, be ranked under the general head of <i>Restrictives, Indexes</i>,
or <i>Defining Adjectives</i>. But, as there is a marked distinction in their
particular meaning and application, each class requires a separate
explanation. Hence, no practical advantage would be gained, by rejecting
their established classification, as articles, numerals, and
demonstratives, and by giving them <i>new</i> names. The character and
application of <i>a</i> and <i>the</i> can be learned as soon when they are styled
<i>articles</i>, as when they are denominated <i>specifying</i> or <i>defining
adjectives</i>.</p>

<p>The history of this part of speech is very brief. As there are but two
articles, <i>a</i> or <i>an</i> and <i>the</i>, you will know them wherever they occur.</p>

<p>A noun used without an article, or any other restrictive, is taken in
its <i>general</i> sense; as, <i>&quot;Fruit</i> is abundant;&quot; &quot;<i>Gold</i> is heavy;&quot;
&quot;<i>Man</i> is born to trouble&quot; Here we mean, fruit and gold <i>in general;</i>
and <i>all men</i>, or <i>mankind</i>.</p>

<a name="the_ii"></a>
<p>When we wish to limit the meaning of the noun to <i>one</i> object, but to no
<i>particular</i> one, we employ <i>a</i> or <i>an</i>. If I say, &quot;Give me <i>a</i> pen;&quot;
&quot;Bring me <i>an</i> apple;&quot; you are at liberty to fetch <i>any</i> pen or <i>any</i>
apple you please. <i>A</i> or <i>an</i>, then, is <i>indefinite</i>, because it leaves
the meaning of the noun to which it is applied, as far as regards the
person spoken to, <i>vague</i>, or <i>indeterminate</i>; that is, <i>not definite</i>.
But when reference is made to a <i>particular</i> object, we employ <i>the</i>,
as, &quot;Give me <i>the</i> pen;&quot; &quot;Bring me <i>the</i> apple, or <i>the</i> apple.&quot; When
such a requisition is made, you are not at liberty to bring any pen or
apple you please, but you must fetch the <i>particular</i> pen or apple to
which you know me to refer. <i>The</i> is, therefore, called the <i>definite</i>
article.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>A</i> star appears.&quot; Here, the star referred to, may be known as a
<i>particular</i> star, <i>definite</i>, and distinguished from all others, in the
mind of the <i>speaker</i>; but to the <i>hearer</i>, it is left, among the
thousands that bedeck the vault of heaven, <i>undistinguished</i> and
<i>indefinite</i>. But when the star has previously been made the subject of
discourse, it becomes, in the minds of both speaker and hearer a
<i>definite</i> object, and he says, &quot;<i>The</i> star appears;&quot; that is, that
<i>particular</i> star about which we were discoursing.</p>

<p>&quot;Solomon built <i>a</i> temple.&quot; Did he build <i>any</i> temple, <i>undetermined
which?</i> No; it was a <i>particular</i> temple, pre-eminently distinguished
from all others. But <i>how</i> does it become a definite object in the mind
of the <i>hearer</i>? Certainly, not by the phrase, &quot;<i>a</i> temple,&quot; which
indicates <i>any</i> temple, leaving it altogether <i>undetermined</i> which; but
supposing the person addressed was totally unacquainted with the fact
asserted, and it becomes to him, <i>in one respect only</i>, a definite and
particular temple, by means of the associated words, &quot;Solomon built;&quot;
that is, by the use of these words in connexion with the others, the
hearer gets the idea of a temple distinguished as <i>the one erected by
Solomon</i>. If the speaker were addressing one whom he supposed to be
unacquainted with the fact related, he might make the temple referred to
a still more definite object in the mind of the hearer by a farther
explanation of it; thus, &quot;Solomon built <i>a</i> temple <i>on mount Zion</i>; and
that was <i>the</i> temple <i>to which the Jews resorted to worship</i>.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;<i>The</i> lunatic, <i>the</i> poet, and <i>the</i> lover,<br />
&quot;Are of imagination all compact.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>The</i> horse is a noble animal;&quot; &quot;<i>The</i> dog is a faithful creature;&quot;
&quot;<i>The</i> wind blows;&quot; &quot;<i>The</i> wolves were howling in <i>the</i> woods.&quot; In these
examples, we do not refer to any particular lunatics, poets, lovers,
horses, dogs, winds, wolves, and woods, but we refer to these
<i>particular classes</i> of things, in contradistinction to other objects or
classes. The phrase, &quot;Neither <i>the</i> one nor <i>the</i> other,&quot; is an idiom of
the language.</p>

<div class="smalltext">REMARKS.&mdash;This method of elucidating the articles, which is popular
with Blair, Priestley, Lowth, Johnson, Harris, Beattie, Coote,
Murray, and many other distinguished philologists, is discarded by
some of our modern writers. But, by proving that this theory is
exceptionable, they by no means make it appear, that it ought,
therefore, to be rejected.</div>

<div class="smalltext">Exceptionable or not, they have not been able to supply its place
with one that is more <i>convenient in practice</i>. Neither have they
adopted one <i>less</i> exceptionable. The truth is, after all which can
be done to render the definitions and rules of grammar comprehensive
and accurate, they will still be found, when critically examined by
men of learning and science, more or less exceptionable. These
exceptions and imperfections are the unavoidable consequence of the
imperfections of the language. Language, as well as every thing else
of human invention, will always be <i>imperfect</i>. Consequently, a
<i>perfect</i> system of grammatical principles, would not suit it. A
<i>perfect</i> grammar will not be produced, until some <i>perfect</i> being
writes it for a <i>perfect</i> language; and a perfect language will not
be constructed, until some <i>super-human</i> agency is employed in its
production. All grammatical principles and systems which are not
<i>perfect</i>, are <i>exceptionable</i>.</div>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">1. The article is <i>omitted</i> before nouns implying the different
virtues, vices, passions, qualities, sciences, arts, metals, herbs,
&amp;c.; as, &quot;<i>Modesty</i> is becoming; <i>Falsehood</i> is odious; <i>Grammar</i> is
useful,&quot; &amp;c.</div>

<div class="smalltext">2. The article is not prefixed to proper nouns; as, <i>Barron</i> killed
<i>Decatur</i>; except by way of eminence, or for the sake of
distinguishing a particular family, or when some noun is understood;
as, &quot;He is not <i>a</i> Franklin; He is <i>a</i> Lee, or of the family of
<i>the</i> Lees; We sailed down <i>the</i> (river) Missouri.&quot;</div>

<div class="smalltext">3. An <i>adjective</i> is frequently placed between the article and the
noun with which the article agrees; as, &quot;A <i>good</i> boy; an
<i>industrious</i> man.&quot; Sometimes the adjective precedes the article;
as, &quot;As <i>great</i> a man as Alexander; <i>Such</i> a shame.&quot;</div>

<div class="smalltext">4. In referring to many individuals, when we wish to bring each
separately under consideration, the indefinite article is sometimes
placed between the adjective <i>many</i> and a singular noun; as, &quot;Where
<i>many a rosebud</i> rears its blushing head;&quot; &quot;Full <i>many a flower</i> is
born to blush unseen.&quot;</div>

<div class="smalltext">5. The definite article <i>the</i> is frequently applied to <i>adverbs</i> in
the comparative or superlative degree; as, &quot;<i>The more</i> I examine it,
<i>the better</i> I like it,&quot; &quot;I like this <i>the least</i> of any.&quot;</div>

<p>You may proceed and parse the following articles, when you shall have
committed this</p>

<h4>SYSTEMATIC ORDER OF PARSING</h4>

<div class="bigtext"><i>The order of parsing an</i> Article, is&mdash;an article, and why?&mdash;definite or
indefinite, and why?&mdash;with what noun does it agree?&mdash;RULE.</div>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;He is <i>the</i> son of <i>a</i> king.&quot;</p>

<p><i>The</i> is an article, a word prefixed to a noun to limit its
signification&mdash;definite, it limits the noun to a particular object&mdash;it
belongs to the noun &quot;son,&quot; according to</p>

<p>RULE 2. <i>The definite article</i> the <i>belongs to nouns in the singular or
plural number</i>.</p>

<p><i>A</i> is an article, a word placed before a noun to limit its
signification&mdash;indefinite, it limits the noun to one of a kind, but to
no particular one&mdash;it agrees with &quot;king,&quot; agreeably to</p>

<p>RULE 1. <i>The article</i> a <i>or</i> an <i>agrees with nouns in the singular
number only</i>.</p>

<div class="smalltext">NOTE. By considering the original meaning of this article, the
propriety of Rule 1, will appear. <i>A</i> or <i>an</i>, (formerly written
<i>ane,)</i> being equivalent to <i>one, any one</i>, or <i>some one</i>, cannot be
prefixed to nouns in the plural number. There is, however, an
exception to this rule. <i>A</i> is placed before a plural noun when any
of the following adjectives come between the article and the noun:
<i>few, great, many, dozen, hundred, thousand, million</i>; as, <i>a</i> few
<i>men, a</i> thousand <i>houses</i>, &amp;c.</div>

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<p>A bird sings. An eagle flies. Mountains stand. The multitude pursue
pleasure. The reaper reaps the farmer's grain. Farmers mow the grass.
Farmers' boys spread the hay. The clerk sells the merchant's goods. An
ostrich outruns an Arab's horse. Cecrops founded Athens. Gallileo
invented the telescope. James Macpherson translated Ossian's poems. Sir
Francis Drake circumnavigated the globe. Doctor Benjamin Franklin
invented the lightning-rod. Washington Irving wrote the Sketch-Book.</p>

<p>I will now offer a few remarks on the misapplication of the articles,
which, with the exercise of your own discriminating powers, will enable
you to use them with propriety. But, before you proceed, please to
answer the following</p>

<h4>PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES.</h4>

<h5>A, AN, THE.</h5>

<div class="smalltext">In a scientific arrangement of grammatical principles, <i>a</i> and <i>the</i>
belong to that class of adjectives denominated <i>definitives</i> or
<i>restrictives</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext"><i>A, an, ane</i>, or <i>one</i>, is the past participle of <i>ananad</i>, to add,
to join. It denotes that the thing to which it is prefixed, is
<i>added, united, aned, an-d, oned, (woned,)</i> or made <i>one</i>.</div>

<div class="smalltext"><i>The</i> and <i><a name="that_i"></a>that</i>. According to Horne Tooke, <i>the</i> is the imperative,
and <i>that</i>, the past participle, of the Anglo-Saxon verb <i>thean</i>, to
get, take, assume. <i>The</i> and <i>that</i> had, originally, the same
meaning. The difference in their present application, is a modern
refinement. Hence, <i>that</i>, as well as <i>the</i>, was formerly used,
indifferently, before either a singular or a plural noun.</div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<h4>QUESTIONS ON THE NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">Before what nouns is the article omitted?&mdash;Is the article <i>the</i> ever
applied to adverbs?&mdash;Give examples.&mdash;What is the meaning of <i>a</i> or <i>an</i>?
&mdash;When is <i>a</i> or <i>an</i> placed before a plural noun?&mdash;From what are <i>a,
the</i>, and <i>that</i> derived?</div>

<h4>EXERCISES IN FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>NOTE TO RULE 1. <i>An</i> is used before a vowel or silent <i>h</i>, and <i>a</i>
before a consonant or <i>u</i> long, and also before the word <i>one</i>.</p>

<div class="smalltext">It is not only disagreeable to the ear, but, according to this note,
improper to say, <i>a</i> apple, <i>a</i> humble suppliant, <i>an</i> hero, <i>an</i>
university, because the word <i>apple</i> begins with a vowel, and <i>h</i> is not
sounded in the word <i>humble</i>, for which reasons <i>a</i> should be <i>an</i> in
the first two examples; but, as the <i>h</i> is sounded in <i>hero</i>, and the
<i>u</i> is long in <i>university, a</i> ought to be prefixed to these words:
thus, <i>an</i> apple, <i>an</i> humble suppliant: <i>a</i> hero, <i>a</i> university. You
may correct the following</div>


<h4>EXAMPLES.</h4>

<p>A enemy, a inkstand, a hour, an horse, an herald, an heart, an heathen,
an union, a umbrella, an useful book, many an one. This is an hard
saying. They met with an heavy loss. He would not give an hat for an
horse.</p>

<p>NOTE 1, TO RULE 2. The articles are often properly omitted: when used
they should be justly applied, according to their distinct character;
as, &quot;Gold is corrupting; <i>The</i> sea is green; <i>A</i> lion is bold.&quot; It would
be improper to say, <i>The</i> gold is corrupting; Sea is green; Lion is
bold.</p>

<p>The grass is good for horses, and the wheat for men. Grass is good for
the horses, and wheat for the men. Grass looks well. Wheat is blighted.</p>

<div class="smalltext">In the first of these sentences, we are not speaking of any particular
kind of <i>grass</i> or <i>wheat</i>, neither do we wish to limit the meaning to
any particular crop or field of grass, or quantity of wheat; but we are
speaking of grass and wheat generally, therefore the article <i>the</i>
should be omitted. In the second sentence, we do not refer to any
definite kind, quality, or number of <i>horses</i> or <i>men</i>; but to horses
and men generally; that is, the terms are here used to denote <i>whole
species</i>, therefore, the article should be omitted, and the sentence
should read thus, &quot;Grass is good for horses, and wheat for men.&quot;</div>

<div class="smalltext">In the third and fourth examples, we wish to limit our meaning to the
crops of <i>grass</i> and <i>wheat</i> now on the ground, which, in
contradistinction to the crops heretofore raised, are considered as
<i>particular</i> objects; therefore we should say, &quot;<i>The</i> grass looks
well; <i>The</i> wheat is blighted.&quot;</div>

<p>NOTE 2. When a noun is used in its <i>general</i> sense, the article should
be omitted; as, &quot;<i>Poetry</i> is a pleasing art;&quot; &quot;<i>Oranges</i> grow in New
Orleans.&quot;</p>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>Corn in the garden, grows well; but corn in the field, does not. How
does the tobacco sell? The tobacco is dear. How do you like the study of
the grammar? The grammar is a pleasing study. A candid temper is proper
for the man. World is wide. The man is mortal. And I persecuted this way
unto the death. The earth, the air, the fire, and the water, are the
four elements of the old philosophers.</p>

<a name='adjectives_ii'></a>
<h3>OF ADJECTIVES.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">An ADJECTIVE is a word added to a noun to express its quality or kind,
or to restrict its meaning; as, a <i>good</i> man, a <i>bad</i> man, <i>a free</i> man,
an <i>unfortunate</i> man, <i>one</i> man, <i>forty</i> men.</div>

<p>In the phrases, a <i>good</i> apple, a <i>bad</i> apple, a <i>large</i> apple, a
<i>small</i> apple, a <i>red</i> apple, a <i>white</i> apple, a <i>green</i> apple, a
<i>sweet</i> apple, a <i>sour</i> apple, a <i>bitter</i> apple, a <i>round</i> apple, a
<i>hard</i> apple, a <i>soft</i> apple, a <i>mellow</i> apple, a <i>fair</i> apple, a <i>May</i>
apple, an <i>early</i> apple, a <i>late</i> apple, a <i>winter</i> apple, a <i>crab</i>
apple, a <i>thorn</i> apple, a <i>well-tasted</i> apple, an <i>ill-looking</i> apple, a
<i>water-cored</i> apple, you perceive that all those words in <i>italics</i> are
adjectives, because each expresses some quality or property of the noun
apple, or it shows what <i>kind</i> of an apple it is of which we are
speaking.</p>

<p>The distinction between a <i>noun</i> and an <i>adjective</i> is very clear. A
noun is the <i>name</i> of a thing; but an adjective denotes simply the
<i>quality</i> or <i>property</i> of a thing. This is <i>fine cloth</i>. In this
example, the difference between the word denoting the <i>thing</i>, and that
denoting the <i>quality</i> of it, is easily perceived. You certainly cannot
be at a loss to know, that the word <i>cloth</i> expresses the <i>name</i>, and
<i>fine</i>, the <i>quality</i>, of the <i>thing</i>; consequently <i>fine</i> must be an
<i>adjective</i>. If I say, He is a <i>wise</i> man, a <i>prudent</i> man, a <i>wicked</i>
man, or an <i>ungrateful</i> man, the words in <i>italics</i> are adjectives,
because each expresses a <i>quality</i> of the noun man. And, if I say, He is
a <i>tall</i> man, a <i>short</i> man, a <i>white</i> man, a <i>black</i> man, or a
<i>persecuted</i> man, the words, <i>tall, short, white, black</i>, and
<i>persecuted</i>, are also adjectives, because they tell what <i>kind</i> of a
man he is of whom I am speaking, or they attribute to him some
particular property.</p>

<p>Some adjectives <i>restrict</i> or <i>limit</i> the signification of the nouns to
which they are joined, and are, therefore, sometimes called
<i>definitives</i>; as, <i>one</i> era, <i>seven</i> ages, the <i>first</i> man, the <i>whole</i>
mass, <i>no</i> trouble, <i>those</i> men, <i>that</i> book, <i>all</i> regions.</p>

<p>Other adjectives <i>define</i> or <i>describe</i> nouns, or do both; as, <i>fine</i>
silk, <i>blue</i> paper, a <i>heavy</i> shower, <i>pure</i> water, <i>green</i> mountains,
<i>bland</i> breezes, <i>gurgling</i> rills, <i>glass</i> window, <i>window</i> glass,
<i>beaver</i> hats, <i>chip</i> bonnets, <i>blackberry</i> ridge, <i>Monroe</i> garden,
<i>Juniata</i> iron, <i>Cincinnati</i> steam-mill.</p>

<p>Some adjectives are <i>secondary</i>, and qualify other adjectives; as,
<i>pale</i> red lining, <i>dark</i> blue silk, <i>deep sea</i> green sash, <i>soft</i> iron
blooms, <i>red hot</i> iron plate.</p>

<p>You will frequently find the adjective placed after the noun; as, &quot;Those
<i>men</i> are <i>tall</i>; A <i>lion</i> is <i>bold</i>; The <i>weather</i> is <i>calm</i>; The
<i>tree</i> is three feet <i>thick</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Should you ever be at a loss to distinguish an adjective from the other
parts of speech, the following sign will enable you to tell it. Any word
that will make sense with the word <i>thing</i> added, or with any other noun
following it, is an adjective; as, a <i>high</i> thing, a <i>low</i> thing, a
<i>hot</i> thing, a <i>cold</i> thing, an <i>unfinished</i> thing, a <i>new-fashioned</i>
thing:&mdash;or, a <i>pleasant</i> prospect, a <i>long-deserted</i> dwelling, an
<i>American</i> soldier, a <i>Greek</i> Testament. Are these words adjectives,
<i>distant, yonder, peaceful, long-sided, double-headed?</i> A distant
<i>object</i> or <i>thing</i>, yonder <i>hill</i>, &amp;c. They are. They will make sense
with a noun after them. Adjectives sometimes become adverbs. This matter
will be explained in Lecture VI. In parsing, you may generally know an
adjective by its <i>qualifying a noun or pronoun</i>.</p>

<p>Most words ending in <i>ing</i> are <i>present participles</i>. These are
frequently used as adjectives; therefore, most participles will make
sense with the addition of the word thing, or any other noun, after
them; as, a <i>pleasing</i> thing, a <i>moving</i> spectacle, <i>mouldering</i> ruins.</p>

<p>In the Latin language, and many others, adjectives, like nouns, have
gender, number, and case; but in the English language, they have neither
gender, person, number, nor case. These properties belong to <i>creatures</i>
and <i>things</i>, and not to their <i>qualities</i>; therefore gender, person,
number, and case, are the properties of <i>nouns</i>, and <i>not</i> of
adjectives.</p>

<div class="bigtext">Adjectives are varied only to express the degrees of comparison. They
have three degrees of comparison, the Positive, the Comparative, and the
Superlative.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>positive degree</i> expresses the quality of an object without any
increase or diminution; as, <i>good, wise, great</i>.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>comparative degree</i> increases or lessens the positive in
signification; as, <i>better, wiser, greater, less wise</i>.</div>

<div class="bigtext">The <i>superlative degree</i> increases or lessens the positive to the
highest or lowest degree; as, <i>best, wisest, greatest, least wise</i>.</div>

<h4>COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES.</h4>

<p><i>More</i> and <i>most</i> form the comparative and superlative degrees by
increasing the positive; and <i>less</i> and <i>least</i>, by diminishing it.</p>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>Words used in counting, are called <i>numeral adjectives</i> of the
<i>cardinal</i> kind; as, <i>one, two, three, four, twenty, fifty,</i> &amp;c.</p>

<p>Words used in numbering, are called <i>numeral adjectives</i> of the
<i>ordinal</i> kind; as, <i>first, second, third, fourth, twentieth, fiftieth,</i>
&amp;c.</p>
</div>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>NOTE. The words <i>many, few</i>, and <i>several</i>, as they always refer to
an indefinite number, may be properly called <i>numeral adjectives</i> of
the indefinite kind.</p>

<h5>NOTES.</h5>

<p>1. The simple word, or Positive, becomes the Comparative by adding
<i>r</i>, or <i>er</i>; and the Positive becomes the Superlative, by adding
<i>st</i>, or <i>est</i>, to the end of it; as, Pos. wise, Com. wise<i>r</i>, Sup.
wise<i>st</i>; rich, rich<i>er</i>, rich<i>est</i>; bold, bold<i>er</i>, bold<i>est</i>. The
adverbs, <i>more</i> and <i>most, less</i> and <i>least</i>, when placed before the
adjective, have the same effect; as, Pos. wise, Com. <i>more</i> wise,
Sup. <i>most</i> wise; Pos. wise, Com. <i>less</i> wise, Sup. <i>least</i> wise.</p>

<p>2. <i>Monosyllables</i> are generally compared by adding <i>er</i> and <i>est;
dissyllables, trisyllables</i>, &amp;c. by <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>; as, mild,
milder, mildest; frugal, more frugal, most frugal; virtuous, more
virtuous, most virtuous. Dissyllables ending in <i>y</i>; as, happy,
lovely; and in <i>le</i> after a mute; as, able, ample; and dissyllables
accented on the last syllable; as, discreet, polite; easily admit of
<i>er</i> and <i>est</i>; as, happi<i>er</i>, happi<i>est</i>; polit<i>er</i>, polit<i>est</i>.
Words of more than two syllables very seldom admit of these
terminations.</p>

<p>3. When the positive ends in <i>d</i>, or <i>t</i>, preceded by a <i>single</i>
vowel, the consonant is doubled in forming the comparative and
superlative degrees; as red, <i>redder, reddest</i>; hot, <i>hotter,
hottest</i>.</p>

<p>4. In some words the superlative is formed by adding <i>most</i> to the
end of them; as, nethermost, uttermost or utmost, undermost,
uppermost, foremost.</p>

<p>5. In English, as in most languages, there are some words of very
common use, (in which the caprice of custom is apt to get the better
of analogy,) that are irregular in forming the degrees of
comparison; as, &quot;Good, better, best; bad, worse, worst; little,
less, least; much or many, more, most; near, nearer, nearest or
next; late, later, latest or last; old, older or elder, oldest or
eldest;&quot; and a few others.</p>

<p>6. The following adjectives, and many others, are always in the
<i>superlative</i> degree, because, by expressing a quality in the
highest degree, they carry in themselves a superlative
signification: <i>chief, extreme, perfect, right, wrong, honest, just,</i>
<i>true, correct, sincere, vast, immense, ceaseless, infinite, endless,</i>
<i>unparalleled, universal, supreme, unlimited, omnipotent, all-wise,</i>
<i>eternal</i>.</p>

<p>7. Compound adjectives, and adjectives denoting qualities arising
from the figure of bodies, do not admit of comparison; such as,
<i>well-formed, frost-bitten, round, square, oblong, circular,</i>
<i>quadrangular, conical</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>8. The termination <i>ish</i> added to adjectives, expresses a slight
degree of quality below the comparative; as, <i>black, blackish; salt,</i>
<i>saltish. Very</i>, prefixed to the comparative, expresses a degree of
quality, but not always a superlative degree.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>That <i>great</i> nation <i>was</i> once <i>powerful</i>; but now it is <i>feeble</i>.</p>

<p><i>Great</i> is an adjective, a word added to a noun to express its
quality&mdash;pos. great, com. greater, sup. greatest&mdash;it is in the positive
degree, it expresses the quality of an object without any increase or
diminution, and belongs to the noun &quot;nation,&quot; according to</p>

<p>RULE 18. <i>Adjectives belong to, and qualify, nouns expressed or
understood</i>.</p>

<p><i>Was</i> is a verb, a word that signifies to be&mdash;neuter, it expresses
neither action nor passion, but being or a state of being&mdash;third person
singular, because its nominative &quot;nation&quot; is a noun of multitude
conveying <i>unity</i> of idea&mdash;it agrees with &quot;nation,&quot; agreeably to RULE
10. <i>A noun of multitude conveying</i> unity <i>of idea, may have a verb or
pronoun agreeing with it in the</i> singular.</p>

<p><i>Powerful</i> is an adjective belonging to &quot;nation,&quot; according to Rule 18.
<i>Feeble</i> belongs to &quot;it,&quot; according to Note 1, under Rule 18. <i>Is</i> is a
neuter verb agreeing with &quot;it,&quot; agreeably to Rule 4.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;Bonaparte entered Russia with 400,000 men.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Four-hundred-thousand</i> is a numeral adjective of the cardinal kind, it
is a word used in counting, and belongs to the noun &quot;men,&quot; according to
Note 2, under Rule 18. <i>Numeral adjectives belong to nouns, which nouns
must agree in number with their adjectives</i>.</p>

<p>NOTE. <i><a name="Like"></a>Like, Worth</i>. The adjective <i>like</i> is a contraction of the
participle <i>likened</i>, and generally has the preposition <i>unto</i>
understood after it. &quot;She is <i>like</i> [<i>unto</i>] her brother.&quot; &quot;They are
<i>unlike</i> [<i>to</i>] him.&quot; &quot;The kingdom of heaven is <i>like</i> [<i>likened</i> or
made <i>like</i>] <i>unto</i> a householder.&quot;</p>

<p>The noun <i>worth</i> has altogether dropped its associated words. &quot;The
cloth is <i>worth</i> ten dollars <i>a</i> yard;&quot; that is, The cloth is <i>of
the</i> worth <i>of</i> ten dollars <i>by the</i> yard, or <i>for a, one</i>, or
<i>every yard</i>.</p>

<p>Some eminent philologists do not admit the propriety of supplying an
ellipsis after <i>like, worth, ere, but, except</i>, and <i>than</i>, but
consider them prepositions. See Anomalies, in the latter part of
this work.</p>
</div> 

<h5>REMARKS ON ADJECTIVES AND NOUNS.</h5>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>A critical analysis requires that the adjective when used without its
noun, should be parsed as an adjective belonging to its noun understood;
as, &quot;The <i>virtuous</i> [<i>persons</i>] and the <i>sincere</i> [<i>persons</i>] are always
respected;&quot; &quot;Providence rewards the <i>good</i> [<i>people,</i>] and punishes the
<i>bad</i> [<i>people.</i>]&quot;</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;The <i>evil</i> [<i>deed</i> or <i>deeds</i>] that men do, lives after them;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;The <i>good</i> [<i>deed</i> or <i>deeds</i>] is oft-interred with their bones.&quot;</span><br />

<p>But sometimes the adjective, by its <i>manner</i> of meaning, becomes a noun,
and has another adjective joined to it; as, &quot;the chief <i>good</i>;&quot; &quot;The
vast <i>immense</i> [<i>immensity</i>] of space.&quot;</p>

<p>Various nouns placed before other nouns, assume the character of
adjectives, according to their <i>manner</i> of meaning; as, &quot;<i>Sea</i> fish,
<i>iron</i> mortar, <i>wine</i> vessel, <i>gold</i> watch, <i>corn</i> field, <i>meadow</i>
ground, <i>mountain</i> height.&quot;</p>

<p>The principle which recognises <i>custom</i> as the standard of grammatical
accuracy, might rest for its support on the usage of only <i>six</i> words,
and defy all the subtleties of innovating skeptics to gainsay it. If the
genius and analogy of our language were the standard, it would be
correct to observe this analogy, and say, &quot;Good, good<i>er</i>, good<i>est</i>;
bad, bad<i>der</i>, bad<i>dest</i>; little, littl<i>er</i>, littl<i>est</i>; much,
much<i>er</i>; much<i>est</i>.&quot; &quot;By <i>this mean</i>;&quot; &quot;What <i>are</i> the <i>news</i>.&quot; But such
a criterion betrays only the weakness of those who attempt to establish
it. Regardless of the dogmas and edicts of the philosophical umpire, the
good sense of the people will cause them, in this instance, as well as
in a thousand others, to yield to <i>custom</i>, and say, &quot;Good, <i>better,
best</i>; bad, <i>worse, worst</i>; little, <i>less, least</i>; much, <i>more, most</i>;&quot;
&quot;By <i>this means</i>;&quot; &quot;What <i>is</i> the <i>news</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>With regard to the using of adjectives and other qualifying words, care
must be taken, or your language will frequently amount to absurdity or
nonsense. Let the following general remark, which is better than a dozen
rules, put you on your guard. Whenever you utter a sentence, or put your
pen on paper to write, weigh well in your mind <i>the meaning of the
words</i> which you are about to employ. See that they convey precisely the
ideas which you wish to express by them, and thus you will avoid
innumerable errors. In speaking of a man, we may say, with propriety, he
is <i>very</i> wicked, or <i>exceedingly</i> lavish, because the terms <i>wicked</i> and
<i>lavish</i> are adjectives that admit of comparison; but, if we take the
words in their literal acceptation, there is a solecism in calling a man
<i>very</i> honest, or <i>exceedingly</i> just, for the words <i>honest</i> and <i>just</i>,
literally admit of no comparison. In point of fact, a man is <i>honest</i> or
<i>dishonest, just</i> or <i>unjust</i>: there can be no medium or excess in this
respect. <i>Very</i> correct, <i>very</i> incorrect, <i>very</i> right, <i>very</i> wrong,
are common expressions; but they are not <i>literally</i> proper. What is not
<i>correct</i>, must be <i>incorrect</i>; and that which is not <i>incorrect</i>, must
be <i>correct</i>: what is not <i>right</i>, must be <i>wrong</i>; and that which is
not <i>wrong</i>, must be <i>right</i>. To avoid that circumlocution which must
otherwise take place, our best speakers and writers, however, frequently
compare adjectives which do not literally admit of comparison: &quot;The
<i>most established</i> practice;&quot; &quot;The <i>most uncertain</i> method;&quot; &quot;Irving, as
a writer, <i>is far more accurate</i> than Addison;&quot; &quot;The metaphysical
investigations of our philosophical grammars, are <i>still more
incomprehensible</i> to the learner.&quot; Comparisons like these, should
generally be avoided; but sometimes they are so convenient in practice,
as to render them admissible. Such expressions can be reconciled with
the principles of grammar, only by considering them as figurative.</p>

<p>Comparative members of sentences, should be set in <i>direct opposition</i>
to each other; as, &quot;Pope was <i>rich</i>, but Goldsmith was <i>poor</i>.&quot; The
following sentences are inaccurate: &quot;Solomon was <i>wiser</i> than Cicero was
<i>eloquent</i>.&quot; &quot;The principles of the reformation were <i>deeper</i> in the
prince's mind than to be <i>easily eradicated</i>.&quot; This latter sentence
contains <i>no comparison</i> at all; neither does it literally convey <i>any
meaning</i>. Again, if the Psalmist had said, &quot;I am the wisest of my
teachers,&quot; he would have spoken absurdly, because the phrase would
imply, that he was one of his teachers. But in saying, &quot;I am wiser
<i>than</i> my teachers,&quot; he does not consider himself one of them, but
places himself in contradistinction to them.</p>

<h4>PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES.</h4>

<h5>ADNOUNS.</h5>

<p><i>Adnoun</i> or <i>Adjective</i>, comes from the Latin, <i>ad</i> and <i>jicio</i>, to
<i>add to</i>.</p>

<p>Adnouns are a class of words added to nouns to vary their
comprehension, or to determine their extension. Those which effect
the former object, are called <i>adjectives</i>, or <i>attributes;</i> and
those which effect the latter, <i>restrictives</i>. It is not, in all
cases, easy to determine to which of these classes an adnoun should
be referred. Words which express simply the <i>qualities</i> of nouns,
are adjectives; and such as denote their <i>situation</i> or <i>number</i>,
are restrictives.</p>

<p>Adjectives were originally nouns or verbs.</p>

<p>Some consider the adjective, in its present application, <i>exactly</i>
equivalent to a noun connected to another noun by means of
juxtaposition, of a preposition, or of a corresponding flexion. &quot;A
<i>golden</i> cup,&quot; say they, &quot;is the same as a <i>gold</i> cup, or a cup <i>of
gold</i>.&quot; But this principle appears to be exceptionable. &quot;A cup <i>of
gold</i>,&quot; may mean either a cup-<i>full</i> of gold, or a cup <i>made</i> of
gold. &quot;An <i>oaken</i> cask,&quot; signifies an <i>oak</i> cask, or a cask <i>of
oak</i>; i.e. a cask <i>made</i> of oak; but a <i>beer</i> cask, and a cask <i>of
beer</i>, are two different things. A <i>virtuous</i> son; a son <i>of
virtue</i>.</p>

<p>The distinguishing characteristic of the adjective, appears to
consist in its both <i>naming</i> a quality, and <i>attributing</i> that
quality to some object.</p>

<p>The terminations <i>en, ed</i>, and <i>ig</i> (our modern <i>y</i>,) signifying
<i>give, add, join</i>, denote that the names of qualities to which they
are postfixed, are to be attributed to other nouns possessing such
qualities: wood-<i>en</i>, wood-<i>y</i>. See page 37.</p>

<p><i>Left</i> is the past participle of the verb <i>leave</i>. Horne Tooke
defines <i>right</i> to be that which is <i>ordered</i> or <i>directed</i>. The
<i>right</i> hand is that which your parents and custom direct you to use
in preference to the other. And when you employ that in preference,
the other is the <i>leaved, leav'd</i>, or <i>left</i> hand; i.e. the one
<i>leaved</i> or <i>left</i>. &quot;The one shall be taken, and the other <i>(leaved)
left</i>.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Own</i>. Formerly a man's <i>own</i> was what he <i>worked for, own</i> being a
past participle of a verb signifying to <i>work</i>.</p>

<p><i>Restrictive</i>. Some restrictives, in modern times, are applied only
to singular nouns; such as <i>a</i> or <i>an, another, one, this, that,
each, every, either</i>. Others, only to plural nouns; as, <i>these,
those, two, three, few, several, all</i>. But most restrictives, like
adjectives, are applied to both singular and plural nouns: <i>first,
second, last, the, former, latter, any, such, same, some, which,
what</i>.</p>

<p><i>Numerals</i>. All numeration was, doubtless, originally performed by
the fingers; for the number of the fingers is still the utmost
extent of its signification. <i>Ten</i> is the past participle of
<i>tynan</i>, to close, to shut in. The hands <i>tyned, tened</i>, closed, or
shut in, signified <i>ten</i>; for there numeration <i>closed</i>. To denote a
number greater than ten, we must begin again, <i>ten</i> and <i>one, ten</i>
and <i>two</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Twain, twa-in, twa-ain, twa-ane</i>, is a compound of <i>two (twa, twae,
twee, twi, two</i> or <i>dwo</i> or <i>duo)</i> and <i>one (ane, ain, an.)</i> It
signifies <i>two</i> units <i>joined, united, aned,</i> or <i>oned. Twenty
(twa-ane-ten)</i> signifies <i>two tens aned, oned</i>, or <i>united</i>. Things
<i>separated</i> into parcels of twenty each, are called <i>scores. Score</i>
is the past participle of <i>shear</i>, to <i>separate</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Ordinals</i> are formed like abstract nouns in <i>eth. Fifth,
sixth</i>, or <i>tenth</i> is the number which <i>fiv-eth, six-eth, ten-eth</i>,
or mak-<i>eth</i> up the number <i>five, six</i>, or <i>ten</i>.
</p>
<a name="manner_of_meaning_ii"></a>
<p>Philosophical writers who limit our acceptation of words to that in
which they were <i>originally</i> employed, and suppose that all the
complicated, yet often definable, associations which the gradual
progress of language and intellect has connected with words, are to
be reduced to <i>the standard of our forefathers</i>; appear not to have
sufficiently attended to the <i>changes</i> which this principle of
association actually produces. As language is transmitted from
generation to generation, many words become the representatives of
ideas with which they were not originally associated; and thus they
undergo a change, not only in the <i>mode</i> of their application, but
also in their meaning. Words being the signs of things, their
meaning must necessarily change as much, <i>at least</i>, as things
themselves change; but this variation in their import more
frequently depends on accidental circumstances. Among the ideas
connected with a word that which was once of primary, becomes only
of secondary importance; and sometimes, by degrees, it loses
altogether its connexion with the word, giving place to others with
which, from some accidental causes, it has been associated.</p>

<p>Two or three instances will illustrate the truth of these remarks.
In an ancient English version of the New Testament, we find the
following language: &quot;I, Paul, a <i>rascal</i> of Jesus Christ, unto you
Gentiles,&quot; &amp;c. But who, in the present acceptation of the word,
would dare to call &quot;the great apostle of the Gentiles&quot; a <i>rascal?
Rascal</i> formerly meant a <i>servant:</i> one devoted to the interest of
another; but now it is nearly synonymous with <i>villain. Villain</i>
<i>once had none of the odium which is now associated with the term;</i>
<i>but it signified one who, under the feudal system, rented or held</i>
<i>lands of another. Thus, Henry the VIII. says to a vassal or tenant,</i>
&quot;As you are an accomplished <i>villain</i>, I order that you receive &pound;700
out of the public treasury.&quot; The word <i>villain</i>, then, has given up
<i>its original idea, and become the representative of a new one, the</i>
word <i>tenant</i> having supplanted it. To prove that the meaning of
words <i>changes</i>, a thousand examples could be adduced; but with the
<i>intelligent reader, proof is unnecessary.</i></p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>NOTE 9, under RULE 18. Double <i>Comparatives</i>
and <i>Superlatives</i> should be avoided; such as, <i>worser, lesser, more</i>
deeper, <i>more</i> wickeder, &amp;c.: <i>chiefest, supremest, perfectest,
rightest</i>; or <i>more</i> perfect, <i>most</i> perfect, <i>most</i> supreme, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Virtue confers the most supreme dignity on man, and it should be his
chiefest desire.</p>

<p>He made the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to
rule the night.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>The phrases &quot;most supreme,&quot; and &quot;chiefest,&quot; in the first sentence, are
incorrect, because <i>supreme</i> and <i>chief</i> are in the superlative degree
without having the superlative form superadded, which addition makes
them double superlatives. They should be written, &quot;confers supreme
dignity,&quot; and, &quot;his chief desire.&quot;</p>

<p>We can say, one thing is <i>less</i> than another, or <i>smaller</i> than another,
because the adjectives <i>less</i> and <i>smaller</i> are in the comparative
degree; but the phrase &quot;<i>lesser</i> light,&quot; in the second sentence, is
inaccurate. <i>Lesser</i> is a double comparative, which, according to the
preceding Note, should be avoided. <i>Lesser</i> is as incorrect as <i>badder,
gooder, worser</i>. &quot;The <i>smaller</i> light,&quot; would be less exceptionable. You
can correct the following without my assistance. Correct them <i>four</i>
times over.</p>

<h3>OF <a name="PARTICIPLES"></a>PARTICIPLES.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>A PARTICIPLE is a word derived from a verb, and partakes of the nature
of a verb, and also of an adjective.</p>

<p>Verbs have three participles, the present or imperfect, the perfect, and
the compound.</p>

<p>The <i>present</i> or <i>imperfect</i> participle denotes action or being
continued, but not perfected. It always ends in <i>ing</i>; as, <i>ruling,
being</i>: &quot;I am <i>writing</i> a letter.&quot;</p>

<p>The <i>perfect</i> participle denotes action or being perfected or finished.
When derived from a regular verb, it ends in <i>ed</i>, and corresponds with
the imperfect tense; as, <i>ruled, smiled:</i> &quot;The letter is <i>written</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>The <i>compound</i> participle implies action or being completed before the
time referred to. It is formed by placing <i>having</i> before the perfect
participle; as, <i>having ruled, having been ruled: &quot;Having written</i> the
letter, he mailed it.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>The term <i>Participle</i> comes from the Latin word <i>participio</i>, which
signifies to <i>partake</i>: and this name is given to this part of speech,
because it <i>partakes</i> of the nature of the verb and of the adjective.</p>

<p>By many writers, the participle is classed with the verb, and treated as
a part of it; but, as it has no nominative, partakes of the nature of an
adjective, requires many syntactical rules which apply not to the verb,
and, in some other respects, has properties peculiar to itself, it is
believed that its character is sufficiently distinct from the verb, to
entitle it to the rank of a separate part of speech. It is, in fact, the
connecting link between, not only the adjective and the verb, but also
the noun and the verb.</p>

<p>All participles are compound in their meaning and office. Like verbs,
they express action and being, and denote time; and, like adjectives,
they describe the nouns of which they denote the action or being. In the
sentences, The boatman is <i>crossing</i> the river; I see a man <i>laboring</i>
in the field; Charles is <i>standing</i>; you perceive that the participles
<i>crossing</i> and <i>laboring</i> express the actions of the boatman and the
man, and <i>standing</i> the state of being of Charles. In these respects,
then, they partake of the nature of verbs. You also notice, that they
<i>describe</i> the several nouns associated with them, like describing
adjectives; and that, in this respect, they participate the properties
of adjectives. And, furthermore, you observe they denote actions which
are still going on; that is, <i>incomplete</i> or <i>unfinished</i> actions; for
which reason we call them <i>imperfect</i> participles.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can illustrate their character more clearly. When the
imperfect or present and perfect participles are placed before nouns,
they become defining or describing adjectives, and are denominated
<i>participial adjectives</i>; as, A <i>loving</i> companion; The <i>rippling</i>
stream; <i>Roaring</i> winds; A <i>wilted</i> leaf; An <i>accomplished</i> scholar.
Here the words <i>loving, rippling, roaring, wilted</i>, and <i>accomplished</i>,
describe or define the nouns with which they are associated. And where
the participles are placed after their nouns, they have, also, this
descriptive quality. If I say, I see the moon <i>rising</i>; The horse is
<i>running</i> a race; The dog is <i>beaten</i>; I describe the several objects,
as a <i>rising</i> moon, a <i>running</i> horse, and a <i>beaten</i> dog, as well as
when I place these participles before the nouns. The same word is a
participle or a participial adjective, according to its manner of
meaning. The preceding illustration, however, shows that this
distinction is founded on a very slight shade of difference in the
meaning of the two. The following examples will enable you to
distinguish the one from the other.</p>

<p>The <i>present</i> or <i>imperfect</i> participle is known by its ending in <i>ing</i>;
as, float<i>ing</i>, rid<i>ing</i>, hear<i>ing</i>, see<i>ing</i>. These are derived from
the verbs, <i>float, ride, hear</i>, and <i>see</i>. But some words ending in
<i>ing</i> are not participles; such as <i>evening, morning, hireling, sapling,
uninteresting, unbelieving, uncontrolling</i>. When you parse a word ending
in <i>ing</i>, you should always consider whether it comes from a verb or
not. There is such a verb as <i>interest</i>, hence you know that the word
<i>interesting</i> is a participle; but there is no such verb as
<i>un</i>interest, consequently, <i>un</i>interesting can <i>not</i> be a participle:
but it is an adjective; as, an <i>uninteresting</i> story. You will be able
very easily to distinguish the participle from the other parts of
speech, when you shall have acquired a more extensive knowledge of the
verb.</p>

<p>Speak the participles from each of these verbs, learn, walk, shun,
smile, sail, conquer, manage, reduce, relate, discover, overrate,
disengage. Thus, Pres. <i>learning</i>, Perf. <i>learned</i>, Comp. <i>having
learned</i>. Pres. <i>walking</i>, Perf. <i>walked</i>, Compound, <i>having walked</i>,
and so on.</p>

<p>You may now commit the <i>order</i> of parsing a participle, and then proceed
with me.</p>

<h4>SYSTEMATIC ORDER OF PARSING.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>The <i>order of parsing</i> a PARTICIPLE, is&mdash;a participle, and why?&mdash;from
what verb is it derived?&mdash;speak the three&mdash;present, perfect, or
compound, and why?&mdash;to what does it refer or belong?&mdash;RULE.</p>
</div>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;I saw a vessel <i>sailing&quot;</i></p>

<p><i>Sailing</i> is a participle, a word derived from a verb, and partakes of
the nature of a verb, and also of an adjective&mdash;it comes from the verb
to sail&mdash;pres. sailing, perf. sailed, comp. having sailed&mdash;it is a
present or imperfect participle, because it denotes the continuance of
an unfinished action&mdash;and refers to the noun &quot;vessel&quot; for its subject,
according to</p>

<p>RULE 27. <i>The present participle refers to some noun or pronoun denoting
the subject or actor</i>.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;Not a breath disturbs the <i>sleeping</i> billow.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Sleeping</i> is a participial adjective, a word added to a noun to express
its quality&mdash;it cannot, with propriety, be compared&mdash;- it belongs to the
noun &quot;billow,&quot; agreeably to</p>

<p>RULE 18. <i>Adjectives belong to, and qualify, nouns expressed or
understood</i>.</p>

<p>You will please to parse these two words several times over, and, by a
little reflection, you will perfectly understand the 27th RULE.
Recollect, the participle never varies its termination to <i>agree</i> with a
noun or pronoun, for, as it has no <i>nominative</i>, it has no agreement;
but it simply <i>refers to</i> an actor. Examples: I see a <i>vessel</i> sailing;
or, I see three <i>vessels</i> sailing. You perceive that the participle
<i>sailing</i> refers to a singular noun in the first example, and to a
plural noun in the second; and yet the participle is in the same form in
both examples. The noun <i>vessel</i> is in the objective case, and governed
by the transitive verb <i>see</i>. But when a verb follows a noun, the ending
of the verb generally varies in order to agree with the noun which is
its nominative; as, the vessel <i>sails;</i> the vessels <i>sail</i>.</p>

<p>In this place it may not be improper to notice another Rule that relates
to the participle. In the sentence, &quot;The man is <i>beating</i> his horse,&quot;
the noun <i>horse</i> is in the objective case, because it is the object of
the action expressed by the active-transitive participle &quot;beating,&quot; and
it is governed by the participle beating, according to</p>

<p>RULE 26. <i>Participles have the same government as the verbs have from
which they are derived</i>.</p>

<p>The principle upon which this rule is founded, is quite apparent. As a
participle derived from a transitive verb, expresses the same kind of
action as its verb, it necessarily follows, that the participle must
govern the same case as the verb from which it is derived.</p>

<p>When you shall have studied this lecture attentively, you may proceed
and parse the following exercises, containing five parts of speech. If,
in analyzing these examples, you find any words which you cannot parse
correctly and <i>systematically</i> by referring to your Compend for
definitions and rules, you will please to turn back and read over again
the whole <i>five</i> lectures. You must exercise a little patience; and, for
your encouragement, permit me to remind you, that when you shall have
acquired a thorough knowledge of these five parts of speech, only <i>five</i>
more will remain for you to learn. Be ambitious to excel. Be thorough in
your investigations. Give your reasoning powers free scope. By studying
these lectures with attention, you will acquire more grammatical
knowledge in <i>three</i> months, than is commonly obtained in <i>two</i> years.</p>

<p>In the following examples, the words <i>purling, crusted, slumbering</i>, and
<i>twinkling</i>, are participial adjectives. <i>There</i> and <i>its</i> you may omit.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<p>Orlando left the herd grazing. The hunters heard the young dog barking.
The old fox heard the sportsman's horn sounding. Deep rivers float long
rafts. Purling streams moisten the earth's surface. The sun approaching,
melts the crusted snow. The slumbering seas calmed the grave old
hermit's mind. Pale Cynthia declining, clips the horizon. Man beholds
the twinkling stars adorning night's blue arch. The stranger saw the
desert thistle bending there its lowly head.</p>

<h4>REMARKS ON PARTICIPLES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>Participles frequently become nouns; as, &quot;A good <i>understanding</i>;
Excellent <i>writing</i>; He made a good <i>beginning</i>, but a bad <i>ending</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Constructions like the following, have long been sanctioned by the best
authorities: &quot;The goods are <i>selling</i>;&quot; &quot;The house is <i>building</i>;&quot; &quot;The
work is now <i>publishing</i>.&quot; A modern innovation, however, is likely to
supersede this mode of expression: thus, &quot;The goods are <i>being sold</i>;&quot;
&quot;The house is <i>being built</i>;&quot; &quot;The work is now <i>being published</i>.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>You may now answer these</p>

<h4>PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>Participles are formed by adding to the verb the <a name="terminations_iv"></a>termination <i>ing,
ed</i>, or <i>en</i>. <i>Ing</i> signifies the same as the noun <i>being</i>. When
<i>postfixed to the noun-state of the verb, the compound word thus</i>
<i>formed, expresses a continued state of the verbal denotement. It</i>
implies that what is meant by the verb, is <i>being</i> continued. <i>En</i>
is an alteration of <i>an</i>, the Saxon verbalizing adjunct; <i>ed</i> is a
contraction of <i>dede</i>; and the terminations <i>d</i> and <i>t</i>, are a
contraction of <i>ed</i>. Participles ending in <i>ed</i> or <i>en</i>, usually
denote the <i>dodo, dede, doed, did, done</i>, or <i>finished</i> state of
what is meant by the verb. The book is <i>printed</i>. It is a <i>print-ed</i>
or <i>print-done</i> book, or such a one as the <i>done</i> act of <i>printing</i>
has made it. The book is <i>written</i>; i.e. it has received the <i>done</i>
or <i>finish-ed</i> act of <i>writ-ing</i> it.</p>

<p><i>Participles bear the same relation to verbs, that adnouns do to</i>
nouns. They might, therefore, be styled <i>verbal adjectives</i>. But
<i>that theory which ranks them with adnouns, appears to rest on a</i>
<i>sandy foundation. In classifying words, we ought to be guided more</i>
by their <i>manner</i> of meaning, and their <i>inferential</i> meaning, than
by their primitive, essential signification. &quot;I have a <i>broken</i>
plate;&quot; i.e. I have a plate&mdash;<i>broken</i>; &quot;I have <i>broken</i> a plate.&quot; If
there is no difference in the <i>essential</i> meaning of the word
<i>broken</i>, in these two constructions, it cannot be denied, that
there is a wide difference in the meaning&mdash;<i>inferred</i> by custom;
which difference depends on the <i>manner</i> in which the term is
applied. The former construction denotes, that I <i>possess</i> a plate
which was <i>broken</i>, (whether with or without my agency, is not
<i>intimated,) perhaps, one hundred or one thousand years ago; whereas,</i>
the meaning of the latter is, that I <i>performed the act</i> of reducing
the plate from a whole to a <i>broken</i> state; and it is not intimated
<i>whether I possess it, or some one else. It appears reasonable, that,</i>
<i>in a practical grammar, at least, any word which occurs in</i>
<i>constructions differing so widely, may properly be classed with</i>
<i>different parts of speech. This illustration likewise establishes</i>
the propriety of retaining what we call the <i>perfect tense</i> of the
<i>verb.</i></p>

<h3>OF ADVERBS.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>An ADVERB is a word used to modify the sense of a <i>verb</i>, a<i>participle</i>,
an <i>adjective</i>, or another <i>adverb</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Recollect, an adverb never qualifies a <i>noun</i>. It qualifies any of the
four parts of speech abovenamed, and none others.</p>

<p>To <i>modify</i> or <i>qualify</i>, you know, means to produce some <i>change</i>. The
adverb modifies. If I say, Wirt's style <i>excels</i> Irving's, the
proposition is affirmative, and the verb <i>excels</i> expresses the
affirmation. But when I say, Wirt's style <i>excels not</i> Irving's, the
assertion is changed to a negative. What is it that thus modifies or
changes the meaning of the verb <i>excels</i>? You perceive that it is the
little word <i>not</i>. This word has power to reverse the meaning of the
sentence. <i>Not</i>, then, is a modifier, qualifier, or negative adverb.</p>

<p>When an adverb is used to modify the sense of a verb or participle, it
generally expresses the manner, time, or place, in which the action is
performed, or some accidental circumstance respecting it. In the
phrases, The man rides <i>gracefully, awkwardly</i>, <i>badly, swiftly,
slowly</i>, &amp;c.; or, I saw the man riding <i>swiftly, slowly, leisurely, very
fast</i>, &amp;c., you perceive that the words <i>gracefully, awkwardly, very
fast</i>, &amp;c., are adverbs, qualifying the verb <i>rides</i>, or the participle
<i>riding</i>, because they express the <i>manner</i> in which the action denoted
by the verb and participle, is done.</p>

<p>In the phrases, The man rides <i>daily, weekly, seldom, frequently, often,
sometimes, never</i>; or, The man rode <i>yesterday, heretofore, long since,
long ago, recently, lately, just now</i> or, The man will ride <i>soon,
presently, directly, immediately, by and by, to-day, hereafter</i>, you
perceive that all these words in <i>italics</i>, are adverbs, qualifying the
meaning of the verb, rides, because they express the <i>time</i> of the
action denoted by the verb.</p>

<p>Again, if I say, The man lives <i>here, near by, yonder, remote, far off,
somewhere, nowhere, everywhere</i>, &amp;c., the words in <i>italics</i> are adverbs
of <i>place</i>, because they tell where he lives.</p>

<p>Adverbs likewise qualify adjectives, and sometimes other adverbs; as,
<i>more</i> wise, <i>most</i> wise; or <i>more wisely, most wisely</i>. When an adverb
is joined to an adjective or adverb, it generally expresses <i>the degree</i>
of comparison; for adverbs, like adjectives, have degrees of comparison.
Thus, in the phrase, A skilful artist, you know the adjective <i>skilful</i>
is in the positive degree; but, by placing the adverb <i>more</i> before the
adjective, we increase the degree of quality denoted by the adjective to
the comparative; as, A <i>more</i> skilful artist: and <i>most</i> renders it
superlative; as, A <i>most</i> skilful artist. And if we place more and most
before other adverbs, the effect is the same; as, skilfully, <i>more</i>
skilfully, <i>most</i> skilfully.</p>

<p>You will generally know an adverb at sight; but sometimes you will find
it more difficult to be distinguished, than any other part of speech in
the English language. I will, therefore, give you some <i>signs</i> which
will assist you a little.</p>

<p>Most words ending in <i>ly</i> are adverbs; such as, <i>politely, gracefully,
judiciously</i>. Any word or short phrase that will answer to any one of
the questions, <i>how? how much? when?</i> or <i>where?</i> is an adverb; as, The
river flows <i>rapidly</i>; He walks <i>very fast</i>; He has gone <i>far away;</i> but
he will <i>soon</i> return; She sings <i>sweetly</i>; They learn <i>none at all</i>.
How, or in what manner does the river flow? <i>Rapidly</i>. How does he walk?
<i>Very fast</i>. Where has he gone? <i>Far away</i>. When will he return? <i>Soon</i>.
How does she sing? <i>Sweetly</i>. How much do they learn? <i>None at all</i>.
From this illustration, you perceive, that, if you could not tell these
adverbs by the sense, you would know them by their answering to the
questions. However, your better way will be to distinguish adverbs by
considering the office they perform in the sentence; or by noticing
their grammatical relation, or their situation, with respect to other
words. To gain a thorough knowledge of their real character, is highly
important. <i>Rapidly, fast, far away, soon, sweetly</i>, &amp;c. are known to be
adverbs by their qualifying the sense of verbs. &quot;A <i>very</i> good pen
writes <i>extremely well.&quot; Well</i>, in this sentence, is known to be an
adverb by its qualifying the sense of the verb <i>writes; extremely</i>, by
its ending in <i>ly</i>, or by its being joined to the adverb <i>well</i> to
qualify it; and <i>very</i> is known as an adverb by its joining the
adjective <i>good</i>.</p>

<p>Expressions like these, <i>none at all, a great deal, a few days ago, long
since, at length, in vain</i>, when they are used to denote the <i>manner</i> or
<i>time</i> of the action of verbs or participles, are generally termed
<i>adverbial phrases</i>.</p>

<p>Adverbs, though very numerous, may, for the sake of practical
convenience, be reduced to particular classes.</p>

<p>1. <i>Of Number;</i> as, Once, twice, thrice, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. <i>Of Order;</i> as, First, secondly, lastly, finally, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. <i>Of Place;</i> as, Here, there, where, elsewhere, anywhere, somewhere,
nowhere, herein, whither, hither, thither, upward, downward, forward,
backward, whence, thence, whithersoever, &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. <i>Of Time</i>. <i>Present</i>; as, Now, to-day, &amp;c. <i>Past</i>; as, Already,
before, lately, yesterday, heretofore, hitherto, long since, long ago,
&amp;c. <i>Future</i>; as, To-morrow, not yet, hereafter, henceforth,
henceforward, by and by, instantly, presently, immediately, ere long,
straightways, &amp;c. <i>Time indefinite</i>; as, Oft, often, oft-times,
often-times, sometimes, soon, seldom, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly,
always, when, then, ever, never, again, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. <i>Of Quantity</i>; as, Much, little, sufficiently, how much, how great,
enough, abundantly, &amp;c.</p>

<p>6. <i>Of Manner</i> or <i>quality</i>; as, Wisely, foolishly, justly, unjustly,
quickly, slowly, &amp;c. Adverbs of quality are the most numerous kind; and
they are generally formed by adding the termination <i>ly</i> to an adjective
or a participle, or by changing <i>le</i> into <i>ly;</i> as, Bad, badly;
cheerful, cheerfully; able, ably; admirable, admirably.</p>

<p>7. <i>Of Doubt</i>; as, Haply, perhaps, peradventure, possibly, perchance.</p>

<p>8. <i>Of Affirmation</i>; as, Verily, truly, undoubtedly, doubtless,
certainly, yea, yes, surely, indeed, really, &amp;c.</p>

<p>9. <i>Of Negation</i>; as, Nay, no, not, by no means, not at all, in no wise,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>10. <i>Of Interrogation</i>; as, How, why, wherefore, whither, &amp;c., and
sometimes when, whence, where.</p>

<p>11. <i>Of Comparison</i>; as, More, most, better, best, worse, worst, less,
least, very, almost, little, alike, &amp;c.</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>1. This catalogue contains but a small portion of the adverbs in our
language. Many adverbs are formed by a combination of prepositions
with the adverbs of place, <i>here, there, where</i>; as, <i>Hereof,
thereof, whereof; hereto, thereto, whereto; hereby, thereby,
whereby; herewith, therewith, wherewith; herein, therein, wherein;
therefore, (i.e. there-for,) wherefore, (i.e. where-for,) hereupon,
hereon, thereupon, thereon, whereupon, whereon, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>2. Some adverbs are composed of nouns or verbs and the letter <i>a</i>,
used instead of <i>at, an</i>, &amp;c.; as, Aside, athirst, afoot, asleep,
<i>aboard, ashore, abed, aground, afloat, adrift, aghast, ago, askance,</i>
<i>away, asunder, astray, &amp;c.</i></p>
</div>

<p>You will now please to read this lecture <i>four</i> times over, and read
slowly and carefully, for unless you understand well the nature and
character of this part of speech, you will be frequently at a loss to
distinguish it from others in composition. Now do you notice, that, in
this sentence which you have just read, the words <i>slowly, carefully,
well</i>, and <i>frequently</i>, are adverbs? And do you again observe, that, in
the question I have just put to you, the words <i>now</i> and <i>just</i> are
adverbs? Exercise a little sober thought. Fifteen minutes spent in
reflection, are worth whole days occupied in careless reading.</p>

<p>In the following exercises six parts of speech are presented, namely,
Nouns, Verbs, Articles, Adjectives, Participles, and Adverbs; and I
believe you are now prepared to parse them all agreeably to the
systematic order, <i>four</i> times over. Those words in <i>italics</i> are
adverbs.</p>

<h4>SYSTEMATIC ORDER OF PARSING.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">
<p><i>The order of parsing an</i> ADVERB, is&mdash;an adverb, and why?&mdash;what
sort?&mdash;what does it qualify?&mdash;RULE.</p>
</div>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;My friend has returned <i>again</i>; but his health is <i>not very</i> good.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Again</i>, is an adverb, a word used to modify the sense of a verb&mdash;of
time indefinite, it expresses a period of time not precisely defined&mdash;it
qualifies the verb &quot;has returned,&quot; according to</p>

<p>Rule 29. <i>Adverbs qualify verbs, participles, adjectives, and other
adverbs</i>.</p>

<p><i>Not</i> is an adverb, a word used to modify the sense of an adverb&mdash;of
negation, it makes the assertion negative; that is, it changes the
proposition from an affirmative to a negative&mdash;and it qualifies the
adverb &quot;very,&quot; agreeably to Rule 29. <i>Adverbs qualify verbs, &amp;c</i>.</p>

<p><i>Very</i> is an adverb, a word used to qualify the sense of an
adjective&mdash;of comparison, it compares the adjective &quot;good,&quot; and
qualifies it according to Rule 29. <i>Adverbs qualify adjectives, &amp;c</i>.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<p>The traveller described a lofty castle decaying <i>gradually. Very</i> few
literary men <i>ever</i> became distinguished poets. The great Milton excels
<i>not</i> Homer. The Roman women, <i>once voluntarily</i> contributed their
<i>most</i> precious jewels to save the city.</p>

<p>Many small streams uniting, form <i>very</i> large rivers. The river Funza
falling <i>perpendicularly</i> forms a vast cataract. Attentive servants
<i>always</i> drive horses <i>very carefully</i>; negligent servants <i>often</i> drive
horses <i>very carelessly</i>. Assiduous scholars improve <i>very fast</i>; idle
scholars learn <i>none at all</i>. Friendship <i>often</i> ends in love; but love
in friendship, <i>never</i>.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>NOTE. Several adverbs frequently qualify one verb. Have you walked? <i>Not
yet quite far enough, perhaps. Not, yet, far</i>, and <i>enough</i>, qualify
&quot;have walked&quot; understood; <i>perhaps</i> qualifies <i>not</i>; and <i>quite</i>
qualifies <i>far</i>. The adverbs <i>always</i> and <i>carefully</i> both qualify the
verb &quot;drive:&quot; the former expresses <i>time</i>, and the latter, <i>manner.
Once</i> and <i>voluntarily</i> qualify the verb &quot;contributed;&quot; the former
expresses <i>number</i>, and the latter, <i>manner</i>. The word <i>their</i> you need
not parse. The active verb <i>to save</i> has no nominative. The nouns <i>love</i>
and <i>friendship</i>, following <i>in</i>, are in the objective case, and
governed by that preposition.</p>

<h4>REMARKS ON ADVERBS.</h4>

<p>When the words <i>therefore, consequently, accordingly</i>, and the like,
are used in connexion with other conjunctions, they are <i>adverbs</i>; but
when they appear single, they are commonly considered <i>conjunctions</i>.</p>

<p>The words <i>when</i> and <i>where</i>, and all others of the same nature, such as
<i>whence, whither, whenever, wherever, till, until, before, otherwise,
while, wherefore</i>, &amp;c. may be properly called <i>adverbial conjunctions</i>,
because they participate the nature both of adverbs and conjunctions; of
adverbs, as they denote the attributes either of <i>time</i> or <i>place</i>; of
conjunctions, as they <i>conjoin sentences</i>.</p>

<p>There are many words that are sometimes used as adjectives, and,
sometimes as adverbs; as, &quot;<i>More</i> men than women were there; I am <i>more</i>
diligent than he.&quot; In the former sentence <i>more</i> is evidently an
adjective, for it is joined to a noun to qualify it; in the latter it is
an adverb, because it qualifies an adjective. There are others that are
sometimes used as nouns, and sometimes as adverbs; as, &quot;<i>to-day's</i>
lesson is longer than <i>yesterday's</i>.&quot; In this example, <i>to-day</i> and
<i>yesterday</i> are nouns in the possessive case; but in phrases like the
following, they are generally considered adverbs of time; &quot;He came [<i>to
his] home yesterday</i>, and will set out again <i>to-day</i>.&quot; Here they are
nouns, if we supply <i>on</i> before them.</p>

<p>&quot;Where <i>much [wealth, talent</i>, or something else] is given, <i>much
[increase, improvement</i>] will be required; <i>Much</i> money has been
expended; It is <i>much</i> better to write than starve.&quot; In the first two of
these examples, <i>much</i> is an adjective, because it qualifies a noun; in
the last, an adverb, because it qualifies the adjective <i>better</i>. In
short, you must determine to what part of speech a word belongs, by its
<i>sense</i>, or by considering the <i>manner</i> in which it is associated with
other words.</p>

<p>An adjective may, in general, be distinguished from an <i>adverb</i> by this
rule: when a word qualifies a <i>noun</i> or <i>pronoun</i>, it is an adjective,
but when it qualifies a <i>verb, participle, adjective</i>, or <i>adverb</i>, it
is an adverb.</p>

<p>Prepositions are sometimes erroneously called adverbs, when their nouns
are understood. &quot;He rides <i>about</i>;&quot; that is, about the <i>town, country</i>,
or some-<i>thing</i> else. &quot;She was <i>near</i> [the <i>act</i> or <i>misfortune of</i>]
falling;&quot; &quot;But do not <i>after</i> [that <i>time</i> or <i>event</i>] lay the blame on
me.&quot; &quot;He came <i>down</i> [the <i>ascent</i>] from the hill;&quot; &quot;They lifted him
<i>up</i> [the <i>ascent</i>] out of the pit.&quot; &quot;The angels <i>above</i>;&quot;&mdash;above
<i>us</i>&mdash;&quot;Above these lower <i>heavens</i>, to us invisible, or dimly seen.&quot;</p>

<h4>PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES.</h4>

<p>As the happiness and increasing prosperity of a people essentially
depend on their advancement in science and the arts, and as
language, in all its sublime purposes and legitimate bearings, is
strictly identified with these, it may naturally be supposed, that
that nation which continues, through successive generations,
steadily to progress in the former, will not be neglectful of the
cultivation and refinement of the latter. The truth of this remark
is illustrated by those who have, for many ages, employed the
English language as their medium for the transmission of thought.
Among its refinements may be ranked those procedures by which verbs
and nouns have been so modified and contracted as to form what we
call adverbs, distributives, conjunctions, and prepositions; for I
presume it will be readily conceded, that conciseness, as well as
copiousness and perspicuity in language, is the offspring of
refinement. That an immense amount of time and breath is saved by
the use of adverbs, the following development will clearly
demonstrate. He who is successful in contracting one mode of
expression that is daily used by thirty millions, doubtless does
much for their benefit.</p>

<p>Most adverbs express in one word what would otherwise require two or
more words; as, &quot;He did it <i>here</i>,&quot; for, He did it <i>in this place;
there</i>, for, <i>in that place; where</i>, for, <i>in what place; now</i>, for,
<i>at this time. Why</i> means <i>for what reason; how&mdash;in what mind, mood,
mode</i>, or <i>manner; exceedingly&mdash;to a great degree; very&mdash;in an
eminent degree; often</i> and <i>seldom</i> signify <i>many times, few times</i>.</p>

<p>The procedures by which words have been contracted, modified and
combined, to form this class of words, have been various. The most
prolific family of this illegitimate race, are those in <i>ly</i>, a
contraction of <i>like. Gentleman-ly</i>, means <i>gentleman-like, like</i> a
gentleman. We do not yet say, <i>ladily</i>, but <i>lady-like</i>. The north
Britons still say, <i>wiselike, manlike</i>, instead of, <i>wisely, manly</i>.
</p>
<p><i>Quick</i> comes from <i>gwick</i>, the past part. of the Anglo-Saxon verb
<i>gwiccian</i>, to vivify, give life. <i>Quick-ly</i> or <i>live-ly</i>, means, in
a <i>quick-like</i> or <i>life-like</i> manner; in the manner of a creature
that has <i>life. Rapid-ly&mdash;rapid-like, like a rapid</i>; a <i>quick-ly</i> or
<i>swift-ly</i> running place in a stream.</p>

<p><i>Al-ways</i>, contraction of <i>in all ways</i>. By a slight transition, it
means <i>in</i> or <i>at all times. Al-one</i>, contraction of <i>all-one.
On-ly&mdash;one-like. Al-so&mdash;all the same</i> (thing.) <i>Ever</i>&mdash;an <i>age</i>. For
<i>ever</i> and <i>ever</i>&mdash;for <i>ages</i> and <i>ages</i>. Ever is not synonymous
with always. <i>Never</i>&mdash;<i>ne ever</i>. It signifies <i>no age, no period of
time. No</i>, contraction of <i>not. Not</i>, a modification of <i>no-thing,
noth-ing, naught</i>. &quot;He is <i>not</i> greater&quot;&mdash;is greater <i>in
naught</i>&mdash;<i>in no thing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Adrift</i> is the past part. <i>adrifed, adrif'd, adrift</i>; from the
Saxon <i>drifan</i>, or <i>adrifan</i>, to drive. <i>Ago</i>, formerly written
<i>ygo, gon, agon, gone, agone</i>, is the past part. of the verb <i>to
go</i>. It refers to time <i>gone by. Asunder</i>, the Saxon past part.
<i>asundren</i>, from the verb <i>sondrian</i> or <i>asondrian</i>, to separate.
<i>Aloft&mdash;on the loft, on luft, on lyft; lyft</i> being the Anglo-Saxon
word for <i>air</i> or <i>clouds. Astray</i>, the part. of <i>straegan</i>, to
stray. <i>Awry</i>, part. of <i>wry than</i>, to writhe.
</p>
<p><i>Needs</i>&mdash;<i>need-is</i>; anciently, <i>nedes</i>, nede is.
To-<i>wit</i>, the infinitive of <i>witan</i>, to know. It means, <i>to be
known</i>. <i>Ay</i> or <i>yea</i> signifies <i>have it, enjoy it. Yes</i> is <i>ay-es</i>,
have, possess, enjoy <i>that</i>. Our corrupt <i>o-yes</i> of the crier, is
the French imperative, <i>oyez</i>, hear, listen. <i>Straight way</i>&mdash;by a
straight way. <i>While&mdash;wheel</i>; period in which some thing <i>whiles</i> or
<i>wheels</i> itself round. <i>Till</i>&mdash;to while. <i>Per</i>, Latin,&mdash;the English
<i>by</i>. Perhaps&mdash;per haps, per chance.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>NOTE 3, TO RULE 29, Adjectives are sometimes improperly applied as
adverbs; as, indifferent honest; excellent well; miserable poor:&mdash;She
writes elegant; He is walking slow.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>The adjectives <i>indifferent, excellent</i>, and <i>miserable</i>, are here
improperly used, because adjectives do not express the degree of
adjectives or adverbs, but such modifications are denoted by adverbs.
The phrases should, therefore, be, &quot;<i>indifferently</i> honest,
<i>excellently</i> well, <i>miserably</i> poor.&quot; <i>Elegant</i> and <i>slow</i> are also
inaccurate, for it is not the office of the adjective to express the
manner, time, or place of the action of verbs and participles, but it is
<i>the office</i> of the adverb. The constructions should be, &quot;She writes
<i>elegantly</i>; He is walking <i>slowly</i>.&quot;</p>

<h2>LECTURE VII
</h2>

<h3>OF PREPOSITIONS.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>A PREPOSITION is a word which serves to connect words, and show the
relation between them.</p>
</div>

<p>The term <i>preposition</i> is derived from the two Latin words, <i>pre</i>, which
signifies <i>before</i>, and <i>pono, to place</i>. Prepositions are so called,
because they are mostly placed before the nouns and pronouns which they
govern in the objective case.</p>

<p>The principal prepositions are presented in the following list, which
you may now commit to memory, and thus you will be enabled to
distinguish them from other parts of speech whenever you see them in
composition.</p>

<h5>A LIST OF THE PREPOSITIONS.</h5>


<table align='center' border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='5' summary=''>
<tr><td align='left'>of</td><td align='left'> over</td><td align='left'> at</td><td align='left'> after</td><td align='left'> betwixt</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>without</td><td align='left'> beyond</td><td align='left'> among</td><td align='left'> underneath</td><td align='left'> according to.</td></tr></table>


<p>This list contains many words that are sometimes used as conjunctions,
and sometimes as adverbs; but when you shall have become acquainted with
the <i>nature</i> of the preposition, and of the conjunction and adverb too,
you will find no difficulty in ascertaining to which of these classes
any word belongs.</p>

<p>By looking at the definition of a preposition, you will notice, that it
performs a <i>double</i> office in a sentence, namely, it <i>connects</i> words,
and also shows a <i>relation</i> between them. I will first show you the use
and importance of this part of speech as a connective. When corn is
ripe&mdash;October, it is gathered&mdash;the field&mdash;men&mdash;who
go&mdash;hill&mdash;hill&mdash;baskets,&mdash;which they put the ears. You perceive, that in
this sentence there is a total want of connexion and meaning; but let us
fill up each vacancy with a preposition, and the sense will be clear.
&quot;When corn is ripe, <i>in</i> October, it is gathered <i>in</i> the field <i>by</i>
men, who go <i>from</i> hill <i>to</i> hill <i>with</i> baskets, <i>into</i> which they put
the ears.&quot;</p>

<p>From this illustration you are convinced, no doubt, that our language
would be very deficient without prepositions to connect the various
words of which it is composed. It would, in fact, amount to nothing but
nonsense. There is, however, another part of speech that performs this
office, namely, the conjunction. This will be explained in Lecture IX.;
in which lecture you will learn, that the nature of a preposition, as a
connective particle, is nearly allied to that of a conjunction. In the
next place I will show you how prepositions express a <i>relation</i> between
words.</p>

<p>The boy's hat is <i>under</i> his arm. In this expression, what relation does
the preposition <i>under</i> show? You know that <i>hat</i> and <i>arm</i> are words
used as signs of two objects, or ideas; but <i>under</i> is <i>not</i> the sign of
a thing you can think of: it is merely the sign of the <i>relation</i>
existing between the two objects. Hence you may perceive, that since the
word <i>under</i> is the sign of the <i>relation</i> existing between particular
<i>ideas</i>, it also expresses a relation existing between the words <i>hat</i>
and <i>arm</i>, which words are the representatives of those ideas.</p>

<p>The boy holds his hat <i>in</i> his hand. In this sentence the preposition
<i>in</i> shows the relation existing between <i>hat</i> and <i>hand</i>, or the
situation, or relative position, each has in regard to the other. And,
if I say, The boy's hat is <i>on</i> his head, you perceive that <i>on</i> shows
the relation between <i>hat</i> and <i>head</i>. Again, in the expressions, The
boy threw his hat <i>up stairs</i>&mdash;<i>under</i> the bed&mdash;<i>behind</i> the
table&mdash;<i>through</i> the window&mdash;<i>over</i> the house&mdash;<i>across</i> the
street&mdash;<i>into</i> the water&mdash;and so on, you perceive that the several
prepositions express the different relations existing between the <i>hat</i>
and the other nouns, <i>stairs, bed, table, window, house, street</i>, and
<i>water</i>.</p>

<p>A preposition tells <i>where</i> a thing is: thus, &quot;The pear is on the
ground, <i>under</i> the tree.&quot;</p>

<p>Prepositions govern the objective case, but they do <i>not</i> express an
action done to some object, as an active-transitive verb or participle
does. When a noun or pronoun follows a preposition, it is in the
objective case, because it is the object of the <i>relation</i> expressed by
the preposition, and <i>not</i> the object of an <i>action</i>.</p>

<a name="objectiveii"></a>
<p>I can now give you a more extensive explanation of the <i>objective case</i>,
than that which was given in a former lecture. I have already informed
you, that the objective case expresses the object of an action <i>or</i> of a
relation; and, also, that there are <i>three</i> parts of speech which govern
nouns and pronouns in the objective case, namely, <i>active-transitive
verbs, participles derived from transitive verbs</i>, and <i>prepositions</i>. A
noun or pronoun in the objective case, cannot be, at the same time, the
object of an action <i>and</i> of a relation. It must be either the object of
an action <i>or</i> of a relation. And I wish you particularly to remember,
that whenever a noun or pronoun is governed by a transitive verb or
participle, it is the object of an <i>action</i>; as, The tutor <i>instructs</i>
his <i>pupils</i>; or, The tutor is <i>instructing</i> his <i>pupils</i>; but whenever
a noun or pronoun is governed by a preposition, it is the object of a
<i>relation</i>; as, The tutor gives good instruction <i>to</i> his <i>pupils</i>.</p>

<p>Before you proceed to parse the following examples, please to review
this lecture, and then the whole seven in the manner previously
recommended, namely, read one or two sentences, and then look off your
book and repeat them two or three times over in your mind. This course
will enable you to retain the most important ideas advanced. If you wish
to proceed with ease and advantage, you must have the subject-matter of
the preceding lectures stored in your mind. Do not consider it an
unpleasant task to comply with my requisitions, for when you shall have
learned thus far, you will understand <i>seven</i> parts of speech; and only
<i>three</i> more will remain to be learned.</p>

<p>If you have complied with the foregoing request, you may commit the
following <i>order</i>, and then proceed in parsing.</p>

<h4>SYSTEMATIC ORDER OF PARSING.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">
<p><i>The order of parsing a</i> PREPOSITION, is&mdash;a preposition, and why?&mdash;what
does it connect?&mdash;what relation does it show?</p>
</div>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;He saw an antelope <i>in</i> the <i>wilderness.&quot;</i></p>

<p><i>In</i> is a preposition, a word which serves to connect words, and show
the relation between them&mdash;it connects the words &quot;antelope&quot; and
&quot;wilderness&quot;&mdash;and shows the relation between them.</p>

<p><i>Wilderness</i> is a noun, the name of a place&mdash;com. the name of a sort or
species&mdash;neut. gend. it denotes a thing without sex&mdash;third pers. spoken
of&mdash;sing. num. it implies but one&mdash;and in the objective case, it is the
object of a <i>relation</i> expressed by the preposition &quot;in,&quot; and governed
by it, according to</p>

<p>RULE 31. <i>Prepositions govern the objective case</i>.</p>

<p>The genius of our language will not allow us to say, Stand before <i>he</i>;
Hand the paper to <i>they</i>. Prepositions <i>require</i> the pronoun following
them to be in the objective form, position, or case; and this
requisition amounts to <i>government</i>. Hence we say, &quot;Stand before <i>him</i>;&quot;
&quot;Hand the paper to <i>them</i>.&quot; Every preposition expresses a relation, and
every relation must have an <i>object</i>: consequently, every preposition
must be followed by a noun or pronoun in the objective case.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<p>The all-wise Creator bestowed the power of speech upon man, for the most
excellent uses. Augustus heard the orator pleading the client's cause,
in a flow of most powerful eloquence. Fair Cynthia smiles serenely over
nature's soft repose. Life's varying schemes no more distract the
laboring mind of man. Septimius stabbed Pompey standing on the shore of
Egypt.</p>

<p>A beam of tranquillity often plays round the heart of the truly pious
man. The thoughts of former years glide over my soul, like
swift-shooting meteors over Ardven's gloomy vales.</p>

<p>At the approach of day, night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast;
and ghosts, wandering here and there, troop home to church-yards.</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Love still pursues an ever devious race,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>True to the winding lineaments of grace.</span><br />

<div class="smalltext">
<p>NOTE.&mdash;The words <i>my</i> and <i>and</i> you need not parse. The noun &quot;meteors,&quot;
following the adverb &quot;like,&quot; is in the objective case, and governed by
<i>unto</i> understood, according to NOTE 2, under Rule 32. The noun &quot;home&quot;
is governed by <i>to</i> understood, according to Rule 32.</p>

<h4>REMARKS ON PREPOSITIONS AND VERBS.</h4>

<p>A noun or pronoun in the objective case, is often governed by a
preposition understood; as, &quot;Give <i>him</i> that book;&quot; that is, &quot;Give that
book <i>to</i> him;&quot; &quot;Ortugrul was one <i>day</i> wandering,&quot; &amp;c. that is, <i>on</i>
one day. &quot;Mercy gives <i>affliction</i> a grace;&quot; that is, Mercy gives a
grace <i>to</i> affliction. See Note 1, under Rule 32.</p>

<p>To be able to make a proper use of prepositions, particular attention is
requisite. There is a peculiar propriety to be observed in the use of
<i>by</i> and <i>with;</i> as, &quot;He walks <i>with</i> a staff <i>by</i> moonlight;&quot; &quot;He was
taken <i>by</i> stratagem, and killed <i>with</i> a sword.&quot; Put the one
preposition for the other, and say, &quot;He walks <i>by</i> a staff <i>with</i>
moonlight;&quot; &quot;He was taken <i>with</i> stratagem, and killed <i>by</i> a sword;&quot;
and it will appear, that the latter expressions differ from the former
in signification, more than one, at first view, would be apt to imagine.</p>

<a name="compound"></a>
<p>Verbs are often compounded of a verb and a <i>preposition;</i> as, to
<i>up</i>hold, to <i>with</i>stand, to <i>over</i>look; and this composition gives a
new meaning to the verb; as, to <i>under</i>stand, to <i>with</i>draw, to
<i>for</i>give. But the preposition is more frequently placed after the verb,
and separately from it, like an adverb; in which situation it does not
less affect the sense of the verb, and give it a new meaning; and in all
instances, whether the preposition is placed either before or after the
verb, if it gives a new meaning to the verb, it may be considered as <i>a
part of the verb</i>. Thus, <i>to cast</i> means <i>to throw</i>; but <i>to cast up</i> an
account, signifies <i>to compute</i> it; therefore <i>up</i> is a part of the
verb. The phrases, <i>to fall on, to bear out, to give over</i>, convey very
different meanings from what they would if the prepositions <i>on, out</i>
and <i>over</i>, were not used. Verbs of this kind are called <i>compound</i>
verbs.</p>

<a name="PRONOUNS"></a>
<h2>LECTURE VIII.</h2>

<h3>OF PRONOUNS.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>A PRONOUN is a word used instead of a noun, and generally to avoid the
too frequent repetition of the same word. A pronoun is, likewise,
sometimes a substitute for a sentence, or member of a sentence.</p>
</div>

<p>The word <i>pronoun</i> comes from the two Latin words, <i>pro</i>, which means
<i>for</i>, or <i>instead of</i>, and <i>nomen</i>, a <i>name</i>, or <i>noun.</i> Hence you
perceive, that <i>pronoun</i> means <i>for a noun</i>, or <i>instead of a noun</i>.</p>

<p>In the sentence, &quot;The man is happy; <i>he</i> is benevolent; <i>he</i> is useful;&quot;
you perceive, that the word <i>he</i> is used instead of the noun <i>man;</i>
consequently <i>he</i> must be a <i>pronoun</i>. You observe, too, that, by making
use of the pronoun <i>he</i> in this sentence, we avoid the <i>repetition</i> of
the <i>noun</i> man, for without the pronoun, the sentence would be rendered
thus, &quot;The man is happy; <i>the man</i> is benevolent; <i>the man</i> is useful.&quot;</p>

<p>By looking again at the definition, you will notice, that pronouns
always <i>stand for</i> nouns, but they do not always <i>avoid the repetition</i>
of nouns. <i>Repetition</i> means <i>repeating</i> or mentioning the same thing
again. In the sentence, &quot;I come to die for my country,&quot; the pronouns,
<i>I</i> and <i>my, stand</i> for the name of the person who speaks; but they do
not <i>avoid the repetition</i> of that name, because the name or noun for
which the pronouns are used, is not mentioned at all. Pronouns of the
<i>third</i> person, generally avoid the repetition of the nouns for which
they stand; but pronouns of the <i>first</i> and <i>second</i> person, sometimes
avoid the repetition of nouns, and sometimes they do not.</p>

<p>A little farther illustration of the pronoun will show you its
importance, and, also, that its nature is very easily comprehended. If
we had no pronouns in our language, we should be obliged to express
ourselves in this manner: &quot;A woman went to a man, and told the man that
the man was in danger of being murdered by a gang of robbers; as a gang
of robbers had made preparations for attacking the man. The man thanked
the woman for the woman's kindness, and, as the man was unable to defend
the man's self, the man left the man's house, and went to a neighbor's.&quot;</p>

<p>This would be a laborious style indeed; but, by the help of pronouns, we
can express the same ideas with far greater ease and conciseness: &quot;A
woman went to a man, and told <i>him</i>, that <i>he</i> was in great danger of
being murdered by a gang of robbers, <i>who</i> had made preparations for
attacking <i>him. He</i> thanked <i>her</i> for <i>her</i> kindness, and, as <i>he</i> was
unable to defend <i>himself</i>, <i>he</i> left <i>his</i> house and went to a
neighbor's.&quot;</p>

<p>If you look at these examples a few moments, you cannot be at a loss to
tell which words are pronouns; and you will observe too, that they all
stand for nouns.</p>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>Pronouns are generally divided into three kinds, the <i>Personal</i>, the
<i>Adjective</i>, and the <i>Relative</i> pronouns. They are all known by the
<i>lists</i>.</p>


<h4>1. OF <a name="PERSONAL_PRONOUNS"></a>PERSONAL PRONOUNS.</h4>

<p>Personal Pronouns are distinguished from the
relative, by their denoting the <i>person</i> of the nouns for which they
stand. There are five of them; <i>I</i>, <i>thou, he, she, it</i>; with their
plurals, <i>We, ye</i> or <i>you, they</i>.</p>

<p>To pronouns belong gender, person, number, and case.</p>
</div>

<p>GENDER. When we speak of a <i>man</i>, we say, <i>he, his, him</i>; when we speak
of a <i>woman</i>, we say, <i>she, hers, her</i>; and when we speak of a <i>thing</i>,
we say <i>it</i>. Hence you perceive, that gender belongs to pronouns as well
as to nouns. Example; &quot;The general, in gratitude to the lady, offered
<i>her his</i> hand; but <i>she</i>, not knowing <i>him</i>, declined accepting <i>it</i>.&quot;
The pronouns <i>his</i> and <i>him</i>, in this sentence, personate or represent
the noun <i>general</i>; they are, therefore, of the masculine gender: <i>her</i>
and <i>she</i> personate the <i>lady</i>; therefore, they are feminine: and <i>it</i>
represents <i>hand</i>; for which reason it is of the neuter gender. This
illustration shows you, then, that pronouns must be of the same gender
as the nouns are for which they stand. But, as it relates to the
variation of the pronouns to express the sex,</p>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>Gender has respect only to the third person singular of the pronouns,
<i>he, she, it. He</i> is masculine; <i>she</i> is feminine; <i>it</i> is neuter.</p>
</div>

<p>You may naturally inquire, why pronouns of the first and second persons
are not varied to denote the gender of their nouns, as well as of the
third. The reason is obvious. The first person, that is, the person
speaking, and the second person, or the person spoken to, being at the
same time the subjects of the discourse, are supposed to be present;
from which, and other circumstances, their sex is commonly known, and,
therefore, the pronouns that represent these persons, need not be marked
by a distinction of gender; but the third person, that is, the person or
thing spoken of, being absent, and in many respects unknown, necessarily
requires the pronoun that stands for it, to be marked by a distinction
of gender.</p>

<p>In parsing, we sometimes apply gender to pronouns of the first and
second person, and also to the plural number of the third person; but
these have no peculiar form to denote their gender; therefore they have
no agreement, in this respect, with the nouns which they represent.</p>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>PERSON. Pronouns have three persons in each number.</p>
</div>


<table align='center' border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' summary='' class='bigtext'>
<tr><td align='left'><i>I</i>, is the first person</td><td align='left'>{</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>Thou</i>, is the second person</td><td align='left'>{Singular.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>He, she</i>, or <i>it</i>, is the third person</td><td align='left'>{</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>We</i>, is the first person</td><td align='left'>{</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>Ye</i> or <i>you</i>, is the second person</td><td align='left'>{Plural.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>They</i>, is the third person</td><td align='left'>{</td></tr></table>


<p>This account of persons will be very intelligible, when you reflect,
that there are three persons who may be the subject of any discourse:
first, the person who speaks, may speak of himself; secondly, he may
speak of the person to whom he addresses himself; thirdly, he may speak
of some other person; and as the speakers, the persons spoken to, and
the persons spoken of, may be many, so each of these persons must have a
plural number.</p>

<p>Pronouns of the second and third person, always agree, in person with
the nouns they represent; but pronouns of the first person, do not.
Whenever a pronoun of the first person is used, it represents a noun;
but nouns are <i>never</i> of the first person, therefore these pronouns
cannot agree in person with their nouns.</p>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>NUMBER. Pronouns, like nouns, have two numbers, the singular and the
plural; as, <i>I, thou, he</i>; <i>we, ye</i> or <i>you, they</i>.</p>

<p>CASE. Pronouns have three cases, the nominative, the possessive, and the
objective.</p>
</div>

<p>In the next place I will present to you the <i>declension</i> of the personal
pronouns, which declension you must commit to memory before you proceed
any farther.</p>

<p>The advantages resulting from the committing of the following
declension, are so great and diversified, that you cannot be too
particular in your attention to it. You recollect, that it is sometimes
very difficult to distinguish the nominative case of a noun from the
objective, because these cases of nouns are not marked by a difference
in termination; but this difficulty is removed in regard to the personal
pronouns, for their cases are always known by their termination. By
studying the declension you will learn, not only the cases of the
pronouns, but, also, their genders, persons, and numbers.</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>1. When <i>self</i> is added to the personal pronouns, as himself,
myself, itself, themselves, &amp;c. they are called <i>compound personal
pronouns</i>, and are used in the nominative or objective case, but not
in the possessive.</p>

<p>2. In order to avoid the disagreeable harshness of sound, occasioned
by the frequent recurrence of the terminations <i>est, edst</i>, in the
adaptation of our verbs to the nominative <i>thou</i>, a modern
innovation which substitutes <i>you</i> for <i>thou</i>, in familiar style,
has generally been adopted. This innovation contributes greatly to
the harmony of our colloquial style. <i><a name="You"></a>You</i> was formerly restricted
to the plural number; but now it is employed to represent either a
singular or a plural noun. It ought to be recollected, however, that
when used as the representative of a singular noun, this word
retains its original <i>plural form</i>; and, therefore, the verb
connected with it, should always be plural. Inattention to this
peculiarity, has betrayed some writers into the erroneous
conclusion, that, because <i>you</i> implies unity when it represents a
singular noun, it ought, when thus employed, to be followed by a
singular verb; as, &quot;When <i>was you</i> there?&quot; &quot;How far <i>was you</i> from
the parties?&quot; Such a construction, however, is not supported by
<i>good</i> usage, nor by analogy. It is as manifest a solecism as to
say, We <i>am</i>, or we <i>is</i>. Were it, in any case, admissible to
connect a singular verb with <i>you</i>, the use of <i>was</i> would still be
ungrammatical, for this form of the verb is confined to the first and
third persons, and <i>you</i> is second person. <i>Wast</i> being second
person, it would approximate nearer to correctness to say, you
<i>wast</i>. We never use the singular of the present tense with
you:&mdash;you <i>art</i>, you <i>is</i>; you <i>walkest</i>, you <i>walks</i>. Why, then,
should any attempt be made to force a usage so unnatural and
gratuitous as the connecting of the singular verb in the past tense
with this pronoun? In every point of view, the construction, &quot;When
<i>were</i> you there?&quot; &quot;How far <i>were</i> you from the parties?&quot; is
preferable to the other.</p>

<a name="compund_personal"></a>
<p>3. The words <i>my, thy, his, her, our, your, their</i>, are, by many,
denominated <i>possessive adjective pronouns</i>; but they always <i>stand
for</i> nouns in the possessive case. They ought, therefore, to be
classed with the <i>personal</i> pronouns. That principle of
classification which ranks them with the adjective pronouns, would
also throw all nouns in the possessive case among the adjectives.
Example: &quot;The lady gave the gentleman <i>her</i> watch for <i>his</i> horse.&quot;
In this sentence <i>her</i> personates, or stands for, the noun &quot;lady,&quot;
and <i>his</i> represents &quot;gentleman.&quot; This fact is clearly shown by
rendering the sentence thus, &quot;The lady gave the gentleman the
<i>lady's</i> watch for the <i>gentleman's</i> horse.&quot; If <i>lady's</i> and
<i>gentleman's</i> are nouns, <i>her</i> and <i>his</i> must be personal pronouns.
The same remarks apply to <i>my, thy, our, your, their</i> and <i>its</i>.
This view of these words may be objected to by those who speculate
and refine upon the principles of grammar until they prove their
non-existence, but it is believed, nevertheless, to be based on
sound reason and common sense.</p>

<p>4. <i>Mine, thine, his, hers, ours, yours, theirs</i>, have, by many
respectable grammarians, been considered merely the possessive cases
of personal pronouns, whilst, by others, they have been denominated
pronouns or nouns in the nominative or objective case. It is
believed, however, that a little attention to the meaning and office
of these words, will clearly show the impropriety of both these
classifications. Those who pursue the former arrangement, allege,
that, in the examples, &quot;You may imagine what kind of faith <i>theirs</i>
was; My pleasures are past; <i>hers</i> and <i>yours</i> are to come; they
applauded his conduct, but condemned <i>hers</i> and <i>yours</i>,&quot; the words
<i>theirs, hers</i>, and <i>yours</i>, are personal pronouns in the possessive
case, and governed by their respective nouns understood. To prove
this, they construct the sentence thus, &quot;You may imagine what kind
of faith <i>their faith</i> was;&mdash;<i>her pleasures</i> and <i>your pleasures</i>
are to come;&mdash;but condemned <i>her conduct</i> and <i>your conduct</i>;&quot; or
thus, &quot;You may imagine what kind of faith the faith of them
was;&mdash;the pleasures of her and the pleasures of you, are to come;&mdash;
but condemned the conduct of her and the conduct of you.&quot; But these
constructions, (both of which are correct,) prove too much for their
purpose; for, as soon as we supply the nouns after these words, they
are resolved into personal pronouns of kindred meaning, and the
nouns which we supply: thus, <i>theirs</i> becomes, their faith: <i>hers</i>,
her pleasures; and <i>yours</i>, your pleasures. This evidently gives us
two words instead of, and altogether distinct from, the first; so
that, in parsing, <i>their faith</i>, we are not, in reality, analyzing
<i>theirs</i>, but two other words of which <i>theirs</i> is the proper
representative. These remarks also prove, with equal force, the
impropriety of calling these words merely simple pronouns or nouns
in the nominative or objective case. Without attempting to develop
the original or intrinsic meaning of these pluralizing adjuncts,
<i>ne</i> and <i>s</i>, which were, no doubt, formerly detached from the
pronouns with which they now coalesce, for all practical purposes,
it is sufficient for us to know, that, in the present application of
these pronouns, they invariably stand for, not only the person
possessing, but, also the thing possessed, which gives them a
<i>compound</i> character. They may, therefore, be properly denominated
COMPOUND PERSONAL PRONOUNS; and, as they always perform a double
office in a sentence by representing two other words, and,
consequently, including two cases, they should, like the compound
relative <i>what</i>, be parsed as two words. Thus, in the example, &quot;You
may imagine what kind of faith theirs was,&quot; <i>theirs</i> is a compound
personal pronoun, equivalent to <i>their faith. Their</i> is a pronoun, a
word used instead of a noun; personal, it personates the persons
spoken of, understood; third pers. plur. numb., &amp;c.&mdash;and in the
possessive case, and governed by &quot;faith,&quot; according to Rule 12.
<i>Faith</i> is a noun, the name of a thing, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;and in the
nominative case to &quot;was,&quot; and governs it; Rule 3. Or, if we render
the sentence thus, &quot;You may imagine what kind of faith <i>the faith of</i>
them<sup><a name='FN_anchor_4'></a><a href='#Footnote_4'>[4]</a></sup> was,&quot; <i>faith</i> would be in the nominative case to &quot;was,&quot; and
<i>them</i> would be in the objective case, and governed by &quot;of:&quot; Rule
<i>31.</i></p>

<p><i>Objections to this method of treating these pronouns, will doubtless</i>
<i>be preferred by those who assert, that a noun is understood after</i>
<i>these words, and not represented by them. But this is assertion</i>
<i>without proof; for, if a noun were understood, it might be supplied.</i>
If the question be put, whose book? and the answer be, <i>mine, ours,
hers</i>, or <i>theirs</i>, the word book is included in such answer. Were
it not included, we might supply it, thus, mine <i>book</i>, ours <i>book</i>,
hers <i>book</i>, and so on. This, however, we cannot do, for it would be
giving a <i>double</i> answer: but when the question is answered by a
<i>noun in the possessive case, the word book is not included, but</i>
implied; as, Whose book? John's, Richard's; that is, John's <i>book</i>;
Richard's <i>book</i>.</p>

<p><i>This view of the subject, without a parallel, except in the</i>
compounds <i>what, whoever</i>, and <i>others</i>, is respectfully submitted
<i>to the public; believing, that those who approve of a critical</i>
<i>analysis of words, will coincide with me. Should any still be</i>
<i>disposed to treat these words so superficially as to rank them among</i>
<i>the simple pronouns, let them answer the following interrogatory: If</i>
<i>what</i>, when compound, should be parsed as two words, why not <i>mine,
thine, his, hers, ours, yours</i>, and <i>theirs</i>?</p>

<p>5. <i>Mine</i> and <i>thine</i>, instead of <i>my</i> and <i>thy</i>, are used in solemn
style, before a word beginning with a vowel or silent <i>h</i>; as, &quot;Blot
out all <i>mine</i> iniquities;&quot; and when thus used, they are not
compound. <i>His</i> always has the same form, whether simple or
compound; as, &quot;Give John <i>his</i> book; That desk is <i>his.&quot; Her</i>, when
placed before a noun, is in the possessive case; as, Take <i>her</i> hat:
<i>when standing alone, it is in the objective case; as, Give the hat</i>
to <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>When you shall have studied this lecture attentively, and committed the

<p>There are many peculiarities to be observed in parsing personal pronouns
in their different persons; therefore, if you wish ever to parse them
correctly, you must pay particular attention to the manner in which the
following are analyzed. Now notice, particularly, and you will perceive
that we apply only <i>one</i> rule in parsing <i>I</i> and <i>my</i>, and <i>two</i> in

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<p>I saw a man leading his horse slowly over the new bridge. My friends
visit me very often at my father's office. We improve ourselves by close
application. Horace, thou learnest many lessons. Charles, you, by your
diligence, make easy work of the task given you by your preceptor. Young
ladies, you run over your lessons very carelessly. The stranger drove
his horses too far into the water, and, in so doing, he drowned them.</p>

<p>Gray morning rose in the east. A green narrow vale appeared before us:
its winding stream murmured through the grove. The dark host of Rothmar
stood on its banks, with their glittering spears. We fought along the
vale. They fled. Rothmar sunk beneath my sword. Day was descending in
the west, when I brought his arms to Crothar. The aged hero felt them
with his hands: joy brightened his thoughts.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>NOTE. <i>Horace, Charles</i>, and <i>ladies</i>, are of the second person, and
nom. case <i>independent</i>: see RULE 5, and NOTE. The first <i>you</i> is used
in the nom. poss. and obj. case.&mdash;It represents Charles, therefore it is
<i>singular</i> in sense, although plural in form. In the next example, <i>you</i>
personifies <i>ladies</i>, therefore it is <i>plural. Given</i> is a perfect
participle. <i>You</i> following given, is governed by <i>to</i> understood,
according to NOTE 1, under Rule 32. <i>Run over</i> is a compound verb. <i>And</i>
is a conjunction. The first <i>its</i> personates vale; the second <i>its</i>
represents stream.</p>
</div>

<p>You may now parse the following examples three times over.</p>

<h5>COMPOUND PERSONAL PRONOUNS.</h5>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;Juliet, retain her paper, and present <i>yours</i>.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Yours</i> is a compound personal pronoun, representing both the possessor
and the thing possessed, and is equivalent to <i>your paper</i>. <i>Your</i> is a
pronoun, a word used instead of a noun&mdash;personal, it personates
&quot;Juliet&quot;&mdash;second person, it represents the person spoken to&mdash;fem.
gender, sing. number, (singular in sense, but <i>plural</i> in form,) because
the noun Juliet is for which it stands: Rule 13. <i>Pers. Pron.
&amp;c</i>.&mdash;<i>Your</i> is in the possessive case, it denotes possession, and is
governed by &quot;paper,&quot; according to Rule 12. <i>A noun or pron. &amp;c.</i> (Repeat
the Rule, and decline the pronoun.) <i>Paper</i> is a noun, the name of a
thing&mdash;common, the name of a sort of things&mdash;neuter gender, it denotes a
thing without sex&mdash;third person, spoken of&mdash;sing. number, it implies but
one&mdash;and in the obj. case, it is the object of the action expressed by
the transitive verb &quot;present,&quot; and governed by it: Rule 20.
<i>Active-transitive verbs govern the obj. case</i>.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>NOTE. Should it be objected, that <i>yours</i> does not mean <i>your paper</i>,
any more than it means <i>your book, your house, your</i> any thing, let it
be borne in mind, that pronouns have no <i>definite</i> meaning, like other
words; but their <i>particular</i> signification is always determined by the
nouns they represent.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<p>Julia injured her book, and soiled mine: hers is better than mine. My
friend sacrificed his fortune to secure yours: his deeds deserve reward;
yours merit disgrace. Henry's labors are past; thine are to come. We
leave your forests of beasts for ours of men. My sword and yours are
kin.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>NOTE. <i>She</i> understood, is nominative to <i>soiled</i>, in the first example;
and the substantive part of <i>mine</i>, after than, is nom. to <i>is</i>,
understood: Rule 35. The verbs <i>to secure</i> and <i>to come</i> have no
nominative. The pronouns <i>mine, my, yours, thine, we, your, ours, my</i>,
and <i>yours</i>, personate nouns understood.</p>

<a name="IT"></a>
<h4>REMARKS ON <i>IT</i>.</h4>

<p>For the want of a proper knowledge of this little pronoun <i>it</i>, many
grammarians have been greatly puzzled how to dispose of it, or how to
account for its multiform, and, seemingly, contradictory characters. It
is in great demand by writers of every description. They use it without
ceremony; either in the nominative or objective case; either to
represent one person or thing, or more than one. It is applied to nouns
in the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender, and, very frequently, it
represents a member of a sentence, a whole sentence, or a number of
sentences taken in a mass.</p>

<p>A little attention to its true character, will, at once, strip it of all
its mystery. <i>It</i>, formerly written <i>hit</i>, according to H. Tooke, is the
past participle of the Moeso-Gothic verb <i>haitan</i>. It means, <i>the said</i>,
and, therefore, like its near relative <i>that</i>, meaning, <i>the assumed</i>,
originally had no respect, in its application, to number, person, or
gender. &quot;<i>It</i> is a wholesome law;&quot; i.e. <i>the</i> <i>said</i> (law) is a
wholesome law; or, <i>that</i> (law) is a wholesome law;&mdash;<i>the assumed</i> (law)
is a wholesome law. &quot;<i>It</i> is the man; I believe <i>it</i> to be them:&quot;&mdash;<i>the
said</i> (man) is the man; <i>that</i> (man) is the man: I believe <i>the said</i>
(persons) to be them; I believe <i>that</i> persons (according to the ancient
application of <i>that</i>) to be them. &quot;<i>It</i> happened on a summer's day,
that many people were assembled,&quot; &amp;c.&mdash;Many people were assembled: <i>it,
that</i>, or <i>the said</i> (fact or circumstance) happened on a summer's day.</p>

<p><i>It</i>, according to its accepted meaning in modern times, is not referred
to a noun understood after it, but is considered a substitute. &quot;How is
<i>it</i> with you?&quot; that is, &quot;How is your <i>state</i> or <i>condition</i>?&quot; &quot;<i>It</i>
rains; <i>It</i> freezes; <i>It</i> is a hard winter;&quot;&mdash;<i>The rain</i> rains; <i>The
frost</i> frosts or freezes; <i>The said</i> (winter) is a hard winter. &quot;<i>It</i> is
delightful to see brothers and sisters living in uninterrupted love to
the end of their days.&quot; What is delightful? <i>To see brothers and sisters
living in uninterrupted love to the end of their days. It, this thing</i>,
is delightful. <i>It</i>, then, stands for all that part of the sentence
expressed in italics; and the sentence will admit of the following
construction; &quot;To see brothers living in uninterrupted love to the end
of their days, is delightful.&quot;</p>

<h4>OF <a name="ADJECTIVE_PRONOUNS"></a>ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS, PRONOMINAL ADJECTIVES, or, more properly, SPECIFYING
ADJECTIVES, are a kind of adjectives which point out nouns by some
distinct specification.</p>
</div>

<p>Pronouns and adjectives are totally distinct in their character. The
former <i>stand for</i> nouns, and never belong to them; the latter <i>belong
to</i> nouns, and never stand for them. Hence, such a thing as an
<i>adjective-pronoun</i> cannot exist. <i>Each, every, either, this, that,
some, other</i>, and the residue, are pure adjectives.</p>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>Those specifying adjectives commonly called Adjective Pronouns, may be
divided into three sorts; the <i>distributive</i>, the <i>demonstrative</i>, and
the <i>indefinite</i>. They are all known by the <i>lists</i>.</p>

<p>I. The <i>distributive adjectives</i> are those that denote the persons or
things that make up a number, each taken separately and singly. <i>List:
each, every, either</i>, and sometimes <i>neither</i>; as, &quot;<i>Each</i> of his
brothers is in a favorable situation;&quot; &quot;<i>Every</i> man must account for
himself;&quot; &quot;<i>Neither</i> of them is industrious.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>These distributives are words which are introduced into language in its
refined state, in order to express the nicest shades and colors of
thought. &quot;<i>Man</i> must account for himself;&quot; &quot;<i>Mankind</i> must account for
themselves;&quot; &quot;<i>All men</i> must account for themselves;&quot; &quot;<i>All men, women,</i>
and <i>children,</i> must account for themselves;&quot; &quot;<i>Every man</i> must account
for himself.&quot; Each of these assertions conveys the same fact or truth.
But the last, instead of presenting the whole human family for the mind
to contemplate in a mass, by the peculiar force of <i>every, distributes</i>
them, and presents each separately and singly; and whatever is affirmed
of one individual, the mind instantaneously transfers to the whole human
race.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p><i>Each</i> relates to two or more persons or things, and signifies either of
the two, or every one of any number taken separately.</p>

<p><i>Every</i> relates to several persons or things, and signifies each one of
them all taken separately.</p>

<p><i>Either</i> relates to <i>two</i> persons or things taken separately, and
signifies the one or the other. &quot;<i>Either</i> of the <i>three</i>,&quot; is an
improper expression. It should be, &quot;any of the three.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Neither</i> imports <i>not either</i>; that is, not one nor the other; as,
&quot;<i>Neither</i> of my friends was there.&quot; When an allusion is made to more
than <i>two, none</i> should be used instead of <i>neither</i>; as, &quot;<i>None</i> of my
friends was there.&quot;</p>
</div>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>II. The <i>demonstrative</i> are those which precisely point out the subject
to which they relate. <i>List: this</i> and <i>that</i>, and their plurals,
<i>these</i> and <i>those</i>, and <i>former</i> and <i>latter</i>; as, &quot;<i>This</i> is true
charity; &quot;<i>that</i> is only its image.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>There is but a slight shade of difference in the meaning and application
of <i>the</i> and <i>that</i>. When reference is made to a particular book, we
say, &quot;Take <i>the</i> book;&quot; but when we wish to be very pointed and precise,
we say, &quot;Take <i>that</i> book;&quot; or, if it be near by, &quot;Take <i>this</i> book.&quot;
You perceive, then, that these demonstratives have all the force of the
definite article, and a little more.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p><i>This</i> and <i>these</i> refer to the nearest persons or things, <i>that</i> and
<i>those</i> to the most distant; as, &quot;<i>These</i> goods are superior to those.&quot;
<i>This</i> and <i>these</i> indicate the latter, or last mentioned; <i>that</i> and
<i>those</i>, the former, or first mentioned; as, &quot;Both <i>wealth</i> and
<i>poverty</i> are temptations; <i>that</i> tends to excite pride, <i>this</i>,
discontent.&quot;</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;<i>Some</i> place the bliss in action, <i>some</i> in ease;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'><i>Those</i> call it pleasure, and contentment, <i>these</i>.&quot;</span><br />

<p><i>They, those</i>. As it is the office of the personal <i>they</i> to represent a
noun previously introduced to our notice, there appears to be a slight
departure from analogy in the following application of it: &quot;<i>They</i> who
seek after wisdom, are sure to find her: <i>They</i> that sow in tears,
sometimes reap in joy.&quot; This usage, however, is well established, and
<i>they</i>, in such constructions, is generally employed in preference to
<i>those</i>.</p>
</div>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>III. The <i>indefinite</i> are those which express their subjects in an
indefinite or general manner. <i>List: some, other, any, one, all, such,
both, same, another none</i>. Of these, <i>one</i> and <i>other</i> are declined like
nouns. <i>Another</i> is declined, but wants the plural.</p>
</div>

<p>The indefinite adjectives, like the indefinite article, leave the
meaning unfixed, or, in some degree, vague. With a slight shade of
difference in meaning, we say, Give me <i>a</i> paper, <i>one</i> paper, <i>any</i>
paper, <i>some</i> paper, and so on. Though these words restrict the meaning
of the noun, they do not fix it to a <i>particular</i> object. We therefore
call them indefinite.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>These adjectives, or adjective pronouns, frequently belong to nouns
understood, in which situation they should be parsed accordingly; as
&quot;You may take <i>either</i>; He is pleased with <i>this</i> book, but dislikes
<i>that</i> (book;) <i>All</i> (men) have sinned, but <i>some</i> (men) have repented.&quot;</p>
</div>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>The words, <i>one, other</i>, and <i>none</i>, are used in both numbers; and, when
they <i>stand for</i> nouns, they are not adjectives, but indefinite
<i>pronouns</i>; as, &quot;The great <i>ones</i> of the world have their failings;&quot;
&quot;Some men increase in wealth, while <i>others</i> decrease;&quot; &quot;<i>None</i> escape.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>The word &quot;ones,&quot; in the preceding example, does not belong to a noun
understood. If it did, we could supply the noun. The meaning is not &quot;the
great one men, nor ones men,&quot; therefore <i>one</i> is not an adjective
pronoun; but the meaning is, &quot;The great <i>men</i> of the world,&quot; therefore
<i>ones</i> is a pronoun of the indefinite kind, representing the noun <i>men</i>
understood, and it ought to be parsed like a personal pronoun. The word
<i>others</i>, in the next example, is a compound pronoun, equivalent to
<i>other men</i>; and should be parsed like <i>mine, thine</i>, &amp;c. See Note 4th,
page 100.</p>

<p>I will now parse two pronouns, and then present some examples for you to
analyze. If, in parsing the following exercises, you should be at a loss
for definitions and rules, please to refer to the compendium. But before
you proceed, you may commit the following</p>

<h4>SYSTEMATIC ORDER OF PARSING.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>The order of parsing an ADJECTIVE PRONOUN, is&mdash;an adjective pronoun, and
why?&mdash;distributive, demonstrative, or indefinite, and why?&mdash;to what
noun does it belong, or with what does it agree?&mdash;RULE.</p>
</div>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;<i>One</i> man instructs many <i>others</i>.&quot;</p>

<p><i>One</i> is an adjective pronoun, or
specifying adjective, it specifically points out a noun&mdash;indefinite, it
expresses its subject in an indefinite or general manner, and belongs to
the noun &quot;man,&quot; according to RULE 19. <i>Adjective pronouns belong to
nouns, expressed or understood</i>.</p>

<p><i>Others</i> is a compound pronoun, including both an adjective pronoun and
a noun, and is equivalent to <i>other men</i>. <i>Other</i> is an adjective
pronoun, it is used specifically to describe its noun&mdash;indefinite, it
expresses its subject in an indefinite manner, and belongs to <i>men</i>:
Rule 19. (Repeat the rule.) <i>Men</i> is a noun, a name denoting
persons&mdash;common, &amp;c. (parse it in full;) and in the objective case, it
is the object of the action expressed by the transitive verb
&quot;instructs,&quot; and gov. by it: Rule 20. <i>Active-transitive verbs, &amp;c</i>.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;<i>Those</i> books are <i>mine</i>.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Those</i> is an adjective pronoun, it specifies what noun is referred
to&mdash;demonstrative, it precisely points out the subject to which it
relates&mdash;and agrees with the noun &quot;books&quot; in the plural number,
according to NOTE 1, under Rule 19. <i>Adjective pronouns must agree in
number with their nouns</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mine</i> is a compound personal pronoun, including both the possessor and
the thing possessed, and is equivalent to <i>my books</i>. <i>My</i> is a pron. a
word used instead of a noun&mdash;personal, it stands for the name of the
person speaking&mdash;first person, it denotes the speaker&mdash;sing. number, it
implies but one&mdash;and in the poss. case, it denotes possession, and is
gov. by &quot;books,&quot; according to Rule 12. (Repeat the rule, and decline
the pronoun.) <i>Books</i> is a noun, the name of a thing&mdash;common, &amp;c. (parse
it in full;)&mdash;and in the nominative case after &quot;are,&quot; according to RULE
21. <i>The verb</i> to be <i>admits the same case after it as before it</i>.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<p>Each individual fills a space in creation. Every man helps a little.
These men rank among the great ones of the world. That book belongs to
the tutor, this belongs to me. Some men labor, others labor not; the
former increase in wealth, the latter decrease. The boy wounded the old
bird, and stole the young ones. None performs his duty too well. None of
those poor wretches complain of their miserable lot.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>NOTE. In parsing the distributive pronominal adjectives, NOTE 2, undo
Rule 19, should be applied.</p>
</div>

<h4>III. OF <a name="RELATIVE_PRONOUNS"></a>RELATIVE PRONOUNS.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>Relative Pronouns are such as relate, in general, to some word or phrase
going before, which is called the antecedent. They are <i>who, which</i>, and
<i>that</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The word <i>antecedent</i>, comes from the two Latin words, <i>ante, before</i>,
and <i>cedo, to go</i>. Hence you perceive, that antecedent means going
before; thus, &quot;The <i>man</i> is happy <i>who</i> lives virtuously; This is the
<i>lady who</i> relieved my wants; <i>Thou who</i> lovest wisdom, &amp;c. <i>We who</i>
speak from experience,&quot; &amp;c. The relative who, in these sentences,
relates to the several words, <i>man, lady, thou</i>, and <i>we</i>, which words,
you observe, come before the relative: they are, therefore, properly
called antecedents.</p>

<p>The relative is not varied on account of gender, person, or number, like
a personal pronoun. When we use a personal pronoun, in speaking of a
man, we say <i>he</i>, and of a woman, <i>she</i>; in speaking of one person or
thing, we use a singular pronoun, of more than one, a plural, and so on;
but there is no such variation of the relative. <i>Who</i>, in the first of
the preceding examples, relates to an antecedent of the mas. gend. third
pers. sing.; in the second, the antecedent is of the fem. gend.; in the
third, it is of the second pers.; and in the fourth, it is of the first
pers. plur. num.; and, yet, the relative is in the same form in each
example. Hence you perceive, that the relative has no peculiar <i>form</i> to
denote its gend. pers. and num., but it always agrees with its
antecedent <i>in sense</i>. Thus, when I say, The <i>man who</i> writes, <i>who</i> is
mas. gend. and sing.; but when I say, The <i>ladies who</i> write, <i>who</i> is
feminine, and plural. In order to ascertain the gend. pers. and num. of
the relative, you must always look at its antecedent.</p>

<h4><a name="WHO_WHICH_and_THAT"></a>WHO, WHICH, and THAT.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">
<p><i>Who</i> is applied to <i>persons, which</i> to <i>things</i> and <i>brutes</i>; as, &quot;He
is a <i>friend who</i> is faithful in adversity; The <i>bird which</i> sung so
sweetly, is flown; This is the <i>tree which</i> produces no fruit.&quot;</p>

<p><i>That</i> is often used as a relative, to prevent the too frequent
repetition of <i>who</i> and <i>which</i>. It is applied both to persons and
things; as, &quot;<i>He that</i> acts wisely, deserves praise; Modesty is a
<i>quality that</i> highly adorns a woman.&quot;</p>
</div>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>1. <i>Who</i> should never be applied to animals. The following
application of it is erroneous:&mdash;&quot;He is like a <i>least</i> of prey,
<i>who</i> destroys without pity.&quot; It should be, <i>that</i> destroys, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>2. <i>Who</i> should not be applied to children. It is incorrect to say,
&quot;The <i>child whom</i> we have just seen,&quot; &amp;c. It should be, &quot;The child
<i>that</i> we have just seen.&quot;</p>

<p>3. <i>Which</i> may be applied to persons when we wish to distinguish one
<i>person of two, or a particular person among a number of others; as,</i>
&quot;<i>Which</i> of the two? <i>Which</i> of them is he?&quot;</p>

<p>4. <i><a name="That_ii"></a>That</i>, in preference to <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>, is applied to persons
<i>when they are qualified by an adjective in the superlative degree,</i>
or by the pronominal adjective <i>same</i>; as, &quot;Charles XII., king of
Sweden, was one of the <i>greatest</i> madmen <i>that</i> the world ever
saw;&mdash;He is the <i>same</i> man <i>that</i> we saw before.&quot;</p>

<p>5. <i>That</i> is employed after the interrogative <i>who</i>, in cases like
the following; &quot;Who <i>that</i> has any sense of religion, would have
<i>argued thus?&quot;</i></p>
</div>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>When the word <i>ever</i> or <i>soever</i> is annexed to a relative pronoun, the
combination is called a <i>compound pronoun</i>; as, <i>whoever</i> or <i>whosoever,
whichever</i> or <i>whichsoever, whatever</i> or <i>whatsoever</i>.</p>
</div>

<h4>DECLENSION OF THE RELATIVE PRONOUNS.</h4>

<h5>SINGULAR AND PLURAL.</h5>


<table align='center' border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='5' summary=''>
<tr><td align='center'><i>Nom.</i></td><td align='left'>who,</td><td align='center'><i>Poss.</i></td><td align='left'>whose,</td><td align='left'><i>Obj.</i></td><td align='left'> whom.</td></tr>

<p><i>Which</i> and <i>that</i> are indeclinable, except that <i>whose</i> is sometimes
used as the possessive case of <i>which</i>; as, &quot;Is there any other doctrine
<i>whose</i> followers are punished;&quot; that is, the followers <i>of which</i> are
punished. The use of this license has obtained among our best writers;
but the construction is not to be recommended, for it is a departure
from a plain principle of grammar, namely, who, whose, whom, in their
applications, should be confined to rational beings.</p>

<p><i>That</i> may be used as a pronoun, an adjective, and a conjunction,
depending on the office which it performs in the sentence.</p>

<p><i>That</i> is a relative only when it can be changed to <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>
without destroying the sense; as, &quot;They <i>that</i> (who) reprove us, may be
our best friends; From every thing <i>that</i> (which) you see, derive
instruction.&quot; <i>That</i> is a demonstrative adjective, when it belongs to,
or points out, some particular noun, either expressed or implied; as,
&quot;Return <i>that</i> book; <i>That</i> belongs to me; Give me <i>that</i>.&quot; When <i>that</i>
is neither a relative nor an adjective pronoun, it is a conjunction; as,
&quot;Take care <i>that</i> every day be well employed.&quot; The word <i>that</i>, in this
last sentence, cannot be changed to <i>who</i> or <i>which</i> without destroying
the sense, therefore you know it is not a relative pronoun; neither does
it point out any particular noun, for which reason you know it is not an
adjective pronoun; but it connects the sentence, therefore it is a
conjunction.</p>

<p>If you pay particular attention to this elucidation of the word <i>that</i>,
you will find no difficulty in parsing it. When it is a relative or an
adjective pronoun, it may be known by the signs given; and whenever
these signs will not apply to it, you know it is a conjunction.</p>

<p>Some writers are apt to make too free use of this word. I will give you
one example of affronted <i>that</i>, which may serve as a caution. The tutor
said, in speaking of the word that, that that that that that lady
parsed, was not the that that that gentleman requested her to analyze.
This sentence, though rendered inelegant by a bad choice of words, is
strictly grammatical. The first <i>that</i> is a noun; the second, a
conjunction; the third, an adjective pronoun; the fourth, a noun; the
fifth, a relative pronoun; the sixth, an adjective pronoun; the seventh,
a noun; the eighth, a relative pronoun; the ninth, an adjective pronoun.
The meaning of the sentence will be more obvious, if rendered thus; The
tutor said, in speaking of the word that, that that that <i>which</i> that
lady parsed, was not the that <i>which</i> that gentleman requested her to
analyze.</p>

<h4><a name="WHAT"></a>WHAT.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">
<p><i>What</i> is generally a compound relative, including both the antecedent
and the relative, and is equivalent to <i>that which</i>; as, &quot;This is <i>what</i>
I wanted;&quot; that is, <i>that which</i>, or, <i>the thing which</i> I wanted.</p>
</div>

<p><i>What</i> is compounded of <i>which that</i>. These words have been contracted
and made to coalesce, a part of the orthography of both being still
retained: <i>what&mdash;wh[ich&mdash;t]hat</i>; (<i>which-that</i>.) Anciently it appeared
in the varying forms, <i>tha qua, qua tha, qu'tha, quthat, quhat, hwat</i>,
and finally, <i>what</i>.</p>

<p><i>What</i> may be used as three kinds of a pronoun, and as an interjection.
When it is equivalent to <i>that which, the thing which</i>, or <i>those things
which</i>, it is a compound relative, because it includes both the
antecedent and the relative; as, &quot;I will try <i>what</i> (that which) can be
found in female delicacy; <i>What</i> you recollect with most pleasure, are
the virtuous actions of your past life;&quot; that is, <i>those things which</i>
you recollect, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When <i>what</i> is a compound relative, you must always parse it as two
words; that is, you must parse the antecedent part as a noun, and give
it a case; the relative part you may analyze like any other relative,
giving it a case likewise. In the first of the preceding examples,
<i>that</i>, the antecedent part of <i>what</i>, is in the obj. case, governed by
the verb &quot;will try;&quot; <i>which</i>, the relative part, is in the nom. case to
&quot;can be found.&quot; &quot;I have heard <i>what</i> (i.e. <i>that which</i>, or <i>the thing
which</i>) has been alleged.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Whoever</i> and <i>whosoever</i> are also compound relatives, and should be
parsed like the compound <i>what</i>; as, &quot;<i>Whoever</i> takes that oath, is
bound to enforce the laws.&quot; In this sentence, <i>whoever</i> is equivalent to
<i>he who</i>, or, <i>the man who</i>; thus, &quot;<i>He who</i> takes that oath, is bound,&quot;
&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Who, which</i>, and <i>what</i>, when used in asking questions, are called
interrogative pronouns, or relatives of the interrogative kind; as,
<i>&quot;Who</i> is he? <i>Which</i> is the person? <i>What</i> are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>Interrogative pronouns have no antecedent; but they relate to the word
or phrase which is the answer to the question, for their subsequent; as,
&quot;<i>Whom</i> did you see? The <i>preceptor. What</i> have you done? <i>Nothing</i>.&quot;
Antecedent and subsequent are opposed to each other in signification.
Antecedent means preceding, or going before; and subsequent means
following, or coming after. <i>What</i>, when used as an interrogative, is
never compound.</p>

<p><i>What, which</i>, and <i>that</i>, when joined to nouns, are specifying
adjectives, or adjective pronouns, in which situation they have no case,
but are parsed like adjective pronouns of the demonstrative or
indefinite kind; as, &quot;Unto <i>which</i> promise our twelve tribes hope to
come;&quot; &quot;<i>What</i> misery the vicious endure! <i>What</i> havock hast thou made,
foul monster, sin!&quot;</p>

<p><i>What</i> and <i>which</i>, when joined to nouns in asking questions, are
denominated interrogative pronominal adjectives; as, &quot;<i>What man</i> is
that? <i>Which road</i> did he take?&quot;</p>

<p><i>What, whatever</i>, and <i>whatsoever, which, whichever</i>, and <i>whichsoever</i>,
in constructions like the following, are compound pronouns, but not
compound relatives; as, &quot;In <i>what</i> character Butler was admitted, is
unknown; Give him <i>what</i> name you choose; Nature's care largely endows
<i>whatever</i> happy man will deign to use her treasures; Let him take
<i>which</i> course, or, <i>whichever</i> course he will.&quot; These sentences may be
rendered thus; &quot;<i>That</i> character, or, <i>the</i> character in <i>which</i> Butler
was admitted, is unknown; Give him <i>that</i> name, or, <i>the</i> name <i>which</i>
you choose; Nature's care endows <i>that</i> happy man <i>who</i> will deign, &amp;c.;
Let him take <i>that</i> course, or <i>the</i> course <i>which</i> he will.&quot; A compound
relative necessarily includes both an antecedent and a relative. These
compounds, you will notice, do not include antecedents, the first part
of each word being the article <i>the</i>, or the adjective pronoun, <i>that</i>;
therefore they cannot properly be denominated compound relatives.&mdash;With
regard to the word <i>ever</i> annexed to these pronouns, it is a singular
fact, that, as soon as we analyze the word to which it is subjoined,
<i>ever</i> is entirely excluded from the sentence.</p>

<p><i>What</i> is sometimes used as an interjection; as, &quot;But <i>what!</i> is thy
servant a dog, that he should do this? <i>What!</i> rob us of our right of
suffrage, and then shut us up in dungeons!&quot;</p>

<p>You have now come to the most formidable obstacle, or, if I may so
speak, to the most rugged eminence in the path of grammatical science;
but be not disheartened, for, if you can get safely over this, your
future course will be interrupted with only here and there a gentle
elevation. It will require close application, and a great deal of sober
thinking, to gain a clear conception of the nature of the relative
pronouns, particularly the compound relatives, which are not easily
comprehended by the young learner. As this eighth lecture is a very
important one, it becomes necessary for you to read it carefully four or
five times over before you proceed to commit the following order.
Whenever you parse, you may spread the Compendium before you, if you

action expressed by the active-transitive verb &quot;saw,&quot; and governed by
it, agreeably to</p>

<p>RULE 16. <i>When a nominative comes between the relative and the verb, the

because it is used in asking a question&mdash;it refers to the word &quot;nothing&quot;
for its <i>subsequent</i>, according to</p>

<p>RULE 17. <i>When the rel. pron. is of the interrog. kind, it refers to the
word or phrase containing the answer to the question, for its
subsequent, which subsequent must agree in case with the interrogative.

<h5>WHO, WHICH, WHAT.</h5>

<p>Truth and simplicity are twin sisters, and generally go hand in hand.
The foregoing exposition of the &quot;relative pronouns,&quot; is in accordance
with the usual method of treating them; but if they were unfolded
according to their true character, they would be found to be very
simple, and, <i>doubtless</i>, much labor and perplexity, on the part of the
learner, would thereby be saved.</p>

<p>Of the words called &quot;relatives,&quot; <i>who</i>, only, is a pronoun; and this is
strictly <i>personal</i>; more so, indeed, if we except <i>I</i> and <i>we</i>, than
any other word in our language, for it is always restricted to persons.
It ought to be classed with the personal pronouns. <i>I, thou, he, she,
it, we, ye, you</i>, and <i>they, relate</i> to antecedents, as well as <i>who.
Which, that</i>, and <i>what</i>, are always adjectives. They never <i>stand for</i>,
but always <i>belong</i> to nouns, either expressed or implied. They
<i>specify</i>, like many other adjectives, and <i>connect</i> sentences.</p>

<p><i>Who</i> supplies the place of <i>which</i> or <i>what</i> and its <i>personal noun</i>.
<i>Who</i> came? i.e. <i>what man, what woman, what person;&mdash;which man, woman</i>,
or <i>person</i>, came? &quot;They heard <i>what</i> I said&quot;&mdash;they heard <i>that</i> (thing)
<i>which</i> (thing) I said. &quot;Take <i>what</i> (or <i>whichever</i>) course you
please;&quot;&mdash;take <i>that</i> course <i>which</i> (course) you please to take.
&quot;<i>What</i> have you done?&quot; i.e. <i>what thing, act</i>, or <i>deed</i> have you
done? &quot;<i>Which thing</i> I also did at Jerusalem.&quot; &quot;<i>Which</i> will you
take?&quot;&mdash;<i>which book, hat</i>, or something else? &quot;This is the tree <i>which</i>
(tree) produces no fruit.&quot; &quot;He <i>that</i> (man, or <i>which</i> man) acts wisely,
deserves praise.&quot;</p>

<p>They who prefer this method of treating the &quot;relatives,&quot; are at liberty
to adopt it, and parse accordingly.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<p>The man who instructs you, labors faithfully. The boy whom I instruct,
learns well. The lady whose house we occupy, bestows many charities.
That modesty which highly adorns a woman, she possesses. He that acts
wisely deserves praise. This is the tree which produces no fruit. I
believe what He says. He speaks what he knows. Whatever purifies the
heart, also fortifies it. What doest<sup><a name='FN_anchor_5'></a><a href='#Footnote_5'>[5]</a></sup> thou? Nothing. What book
have you? A poem. Whose hat have you? John's. Who does that work? Henry.
Whom seest thou? To whom gave you the present? Which pen did he take?
Whom ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. I heard what he
said. George, you may pursue whatever science suits your taste. Eliza,
take whichever pattern pleases you best. Whoever lives to see this
republic forsake her moral and literary institutions, will behold her
liberties prostrated. Whosoever, therefore, will be a friend of the
world, is the enemy of God.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>NOTE. The nominative case is frequently placed after the verb, and
the objective case, before the verb that governs it. <i>Whom</i>, in
every sentence except one, <i>house, modesty, book, hat, pen, him</i>,
the third <i>what</i> and <i>which</i>, the relative part of the first <i>two
whats</i>, are all in the <i>objective</i> case, and governed by the several
verbs that follow them. See RULE 16, and NOTE 1. <i>Tree</i> is nom.
after is, according to RULE 21. Thing, the antecedent part of
<i>whatever</i>, is nom. to &quot;fortifies;&quot; <i>which</i>, the relative part, is
nom. to &quot;purifies.&quot; <i>Nothing</i> is governed by <i>do</i>, and <i>poem</i>, by
<i>have</i>, understood. <i>Henry</i> is nominative to <i>does</i>, understood.
<i>Whose</i> and <i>John's</i> are governed according to RULE 12. <i>I, thou,
you, him</i>, &amp;c. represent nouns understood. <i>Him</i>, in the last
sentence but five, is governed by <i>declare</i>, and <i>I</i> is nominative
to <i>declare. George</i> and <i>Eliza</i> are in the nominative case
independent: Rule 5. &quot;<i>Whatever</i> science,&quot; &amp;c. is equivalent to,
<i>that</i> science <i>which</i> suits your taste;&mdash;&quot;<i>whichever</i> pattern;&quot;
i.e. <i>that</i> pattern <i>which</i> pleases you best. <i>Whoever</i> is a
compound relative; <i>he</i>, the antecedent part, is nominative to &quot;will
behold.&quot; <i>Take</i> agrees with <i>you</i> understood. <i>Forsake</i> is in the
infinitive mood after &quot;see:&quot; Rule 25.
</p>
<h4>REMARKS ON RELATIVE PRONOUNS.</h4>

<p><i>Which</i> sometimes relates to a member of a sentence, or to a whole
sentence, for its antecedent: as, &quot;We are required to fear God and keep
his commandments, <i>which</i> is the whole duty of man.&quot; What is the whole
duty of man? &quot;To fear God and keep his commandments:&quot; therefore, this
phrase is the antecedent to <i>which</i>.</p>

<a name='as_i'></a>
<p>The conjunction <i>as</i>, when it follows <i>such, many</i>, or <i>same</i>, is
frequently denominated a relative pronoun; as, &quot;I am pleased with <i>such
as</i> have a refined taste;&quot; that is, with <i>those who</i>, or <i>them who
have</i>, &amp;c. &quot;Let <i>such as</i> presume to advise others, look well to their
own conduct;&quot; that is, Let <i>those</i>, or <i>them who</i> presume, &amp;c. &quot;<i>As many
as</i> were ordained to eternal life, believed;&quot; that is, <i>they, those</i>, or
<i>all who</i> were ordained, believed. &quot;He exhibited the <i>same</i> testimonials
<i>as</i> were adduced on a former occasion;&quot; that is, <i>those</i> testimonials
<i>which</i> were adduced, &amp;c. But, in examples like these, if we supply the
ellipsis which a critical analysis requires us to do, <i>as</i> will be found
to be a conjunction; thus, &quot;I am pleased with <i>such persons, as those
persons are who</i> have a refined taste; Let <i>such persons, as those
persons are who</i> presume,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>NOTE 1, to RULE 13. When a noun or pronoun is the subject of a verb, it
must be in the nominative case.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>Who will go? Him and I. How does thee do? Is thee well?</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>&quot;Him and I;&quot; not proper, because the pronoun <i>him</i> is the subject of the
verb <i>will go</i> understood, therefore him should be in the nominative
case, <i>he</i>, according to the above NOTE. (Repeat the NOTE.) <i>Him</i> and I
are connected by the conjunction <i>and</i>, and <i>him</i> is in the obj. case,
and I in the nom., therefore RULE 33d, is violated. (Repeat the Rule.)
In the second and third examples, <i>thee</i> should be <i>thou</i>, according to
the NOTE. The verbs, <i>does</i> and <i>is</i>, are of the third person, and the
nom. <i>thou</i> is second, for which reason the verbs should be of the
second person, <i>dost do</i> and <i>art</i>, agreeably to RULE 4. You may correct
the other examples, <i>four</i> times over.</p>
</div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>Him and me went to town yesterday. Thee must be attentive. Him who is
careless, will not improve. They can write as well as me. This is the
man whom was expected. Her and I deserve esteem. I have made greater
proficiency than him. Whom, of all my acquaintances, do you think was
there? Whom, for the sake of his important services, had an office of
honor bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>NOTE 2, to RULE 13. Personal pronouns being used to supply the place of
nouns, should not be employed in the same member of the sentence with
the noun which they represent.</p>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>The men they are there. I saw him the king. Our cause it is just. Many
words they darken speech. That noble general who had gained so many
victories, he died, at last, in prison. Who, instead of going about
doing good, they are continually doing evil.</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>In each of the preceding examples, the personal pronoun should be
omitted, according to Note 2.</p>
</div>

<p>NOTE 3, to RULE 13. A personal pronoun in the objective case, should not
be used instead of <i>these</i> and <i>those</i>.</p>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>


<p>Remove them papers from the desk. Give me them books. Give them men
their discharge. Observe them three there. Which of them two persons
deserves most credit?</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<p>In all these examples, <i>those</i> should be used in place of <i>them</i>. The
use of the personal, <i>them</i>, in such constructions, presents two
objectives after one verb or preposition. This is a solecism which may
be avoided by employing an adjective pronoun in its stead.</p>

<h2>LECTURE IX.</h2>

<h3>OF CONJUNCTIONS.</h3>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>A CONJUNCTION is a part of speech that is chiefly used to connect
sentences, joining two or more simple sentences into one compound
sentence: it sometimes connects only words; as, &quot;Thou <i>and</i> he are
happy, <i>because</i> you are good.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>Conjunctions are those parts of language, which, by joining sentences in
different ways, mark the connexions and various dependances of human
thought. They belong to language only in its refined state.</p>

<p>The term CONJUNCTION comes from the two Latin words, <i>con</i>, which
signifies <i>together</i>, and <i>jungo</i>, to <i>join</i>. A conjunction, then, is a
word that conjoins, or joins together something. Before you can fully
comprehend the nature and office of this sort of words, it is requisite
that you should know what is meant by a sentence, a simple sentence, and
a compound sentence, for conjunctions are chiefly used to connect
sentences.</p>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>A <a name="SENTENCE"></a>SENTENCE is an assemblage of words forming complete sense.</p>

<p>A SIMPLE SENTENCE contains but one subject, or nominative, and one verb
which agrees with that nominative; as, &quot;<i>Wheat grows</i> in the field.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>You perceive that this sentence contains several words besides the
nominative and the verb, and you will often see a simple sentence
containing many parts of speech; but, if it has only one nominative and
one <i>finite</i> verb, (that is, a verb <i>not</i> in the infinitive mood,) it is
a simple sentence, though it is longer than many compound sentences.</p>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>A COMPOUND SENTENCE is composed of two or more simple sentences
connected together; as, &quot;<i>Wheat grows</i> in the field, and <i>men reap</i> it.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>This sentence is compound, because it is formed of two simple sentences
joined together by the word <i>and</i>; which word, on account of its
connecting power, is called a conjunction. If we write this sentence
without the conjunction, it becomes two simple sentences: thus, &quot;Wheat
grows in the field. Men reap it.&quot;</p>

<p>The nature and importance of the conjunction, are easily illustrated.
After expressing one thought or sentiment, you know we frequently wish
to <i>add</i> another, or several others, which are closely connected with
it. We generally effect this addition by means of the conjunction: thus,
&quot;The Georgians cultivate rice <i>and</i> cotton;&quot; that is, &quot;They cultivate
rice <i>add</i> cotton.&quot; This sentence is compound, and without the use of
the conjunction, it would be written in two separate, simple sentences:
thus, &quot;The Georgians cultivate rice. They cultivate cotton.&quot; The
conjunction, though chiefly used to connect sentences, sometimes
connects only words; in which capacity it is nearly allied to the
preposition; as, &quot;The sun <i>and (add)</i> the planets constitute the solar
system.&quot; In this, which is a simple sentence, <i>and</i> connects two
<i>words</i>.</p>

<p>A few more examples will illustrate the nature, and exhibit the use of
this part of speech so clearly, as to enable you fully to comprehend it.
The following simple sentences and members of sentences, have no
relation to each other until they are connected by conjunctions. He
labors harder&mdash;more successfully&mdash;I do. That man is healthy&mdash;he is
temperate. By filling up the vacancies in these sentences with
conjunctions, you will see the importance of this sort of words: thus,
He labors harder <i>and</i> more successfully <i>than</i> I do. That man is
healthy <i>because</i> he is temperate.</p>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>Conjunctions are divided into two sorts, the Copulative and Disjunctive.</p>

<p>I. The Conjunction <i>Copulative</i> serves to connect and continue a
sentence by joining on a member which expresses an addition, a
supposition, or a cause; as, &quot;Two <i>and</i> three are five; I will go <i>if</i>
he will accompany me; You are happy <i>because</i> you are good.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>In the first of these examples, <i>and</i> joins on a word that expresses an
<i>addition</i>; in the second, <i>if</i> connects a member that implies a
<i>supposition</i> or <i>condition</i>; and in the third, <i>because</i> connects a
member that expresses a <i>cause</i>.</p>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>II. The Conjunction <i>Disjunctive</i> serves to connect and continue a
sentence by joining on a member that expresses opposition of meaning;
as, &quot;They came with her, <i>but</i> they went away without her.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p><i>But</i> joins on a member of this sentence which expresses, not only
something added, but, also, <i>opposition</i> of meaning.</p>

<p>The principal conjunctions, may be known by the following <i>lists</i>, which
you may now commit to memory. Some words in these lists, are, however,
frequently used as adverbs, and sometimes as prepositions; but if you
study well the nature of all the different sorts of words, you cannot be
at a loss to tell the part of speech of any word in the language.</p>

<h4>LISTS OF THE CONJUNCTIONS.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">
<p><i>Copulative</i>. And, if, that, both, then, since, for, because, therefore,
wherefore, provided, besides.</p>

<p><i>Disjunctive</i>. But, or, nor, as, than, lest, though, unless, either,
neither, yet, notwithstanding, nevertheless, except, whether, whereas,
as well as.</p>
</div>

<p>Some conjunctions are followed by corresponding conjunctions, so that,
in the subsequent member of the sentence, the latter answers to the
former; as,</p>

<p>1. <i>Though</i>&mdash;<i>yet</i> or <i>nevertheless</i>; as, &quot;<i>Though</i> he was rich, <i>yet</i>
for our sakes he became poor.&quot;</p>

<p>2. <i>Whether</i>&mdash;<i>or</i>; as, &quot;<i>Whether</i> he will go, <i>or</i> not, I cannot tell.&quot;
It is improper to say, &quot;Whether he will go or <i>no</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>3. <i>Either</i>&mdash;<i>or</i>; as, &quot;I will <i>either</i> send it, <i>or</i> bring it myself.&quot;</p>

<p>4. <i>Neither&mdash;nor</i>; as, &quot;<i>Neither</i> thou <i>nor</i> I can comprehend it.&quot;</p>

<p>5. <i>As</i>&mdash;<i>as</i>; as, &quot;She is <i>as</i> amiable <i>as</i> her sister.&quot;</p>

<p>6. <i>As</i>&mdash;<i>so</i>; as, &quot;<i>As</i> the stars, <i>so</i> shall thy seed be.&quot;</p>

<p>7. <i>So</i>&mdash;<i>as</i>; as, &quot;To see thy glory, <i>so as</i> I have seen thee in the
sanctuary.&quot;</p>

<p>8. <i>So</i>&mdash;<i>that</i>; as, &quot;He became <i>so</i> vain, <i>that</i> everyone disliked
him.&quot;</p>

<div class="smalltext">
<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p>1. Some conjunctions are used to connect simple <i>sentences</i> only,
and form them into compound <i>sentences</i>; such as, further, again,
besides, &amp;c. Others are employed to connect simple <i>members</i> only,
so as to make them compound <i>members</i>; such as, than, lest, unless,
that, so that, if, though, yet, because, as well as, &amp;c. But, and,
therefore, or, nor, for, &amp;c., connect either whole sentences, or
simple members.</p>

<p>2. Relative pronouns, as well as conjunctions, serve to connect
sentences; as, &quot;Blessed is the man <i>who</i> feareth the Lord, <i>and</i>
keepeth his commandments.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>You will now please to turn back and read this lecture four or five
times over; and then, after committing the following order, you may
parse the subsequent exercises.</p>

<h4>SYSTEMATIC ORDER OF PARSING.</h4>

<div class="bigtext"><p><i>The order of parsing a</i> CONJUNCTION, is&mdash;a conjunction, and
why?&mdash;copulative or disjunctive, and why?&mdash;what does it connect?</p></div>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;Wisdom <i>and</i> virtue <i>form</i> the good man's character.&quot;</p>

<p><i>And</i> is a
conjunction, a word that is chiefly used to connect sentences; but in
this example it connects only words&mdash;copulative, it serves to connect
and continue the sentence by joining on a member which expresses an
addition&mdash;it connects the words &quot;wisdom and virtue.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Wisdom</i> is a noun, the name of a thing&mdash;(You may parse it in
full.)&mdash;<i>Wisdom</i> is one of the nominatives to the verb &quot;form.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Virtue</i> is a noun, the name, &amp;c.&mdash;(Parse it in full:)&mdash;and in the nom.
case to the verb &quot;form,&quot; and connected to the noun &quot;wisdom&quot; by and,
according to RULE 33. <i>Conjunctions connect nouns and pronouns in the
same case</i>.</p>

<p><i>Form</i> is a verb, a word which signifies to do, &amp;c.&mdash;of the third
person, <i>plural</i>, because its two nominatives, &quot;wisdom and virtue,&quot; are
connected by a copulative conjunction, agreeably to RULE 8. <i>Two or more
nouns in the singular number, joined by</i> copulative <i>conjunctions, must
have verbs, nouns, and pronouns agreeing with them in the</i> plural.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;Wisdom <i>or</i> folly <i>governs</i> us.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Or</i> is a conjunction, a word that is
chiefly used to connect sentences: it sometimes connects
words&mdash;disjunctive, it serves not only to connect and continue the
sentence, but also to join on a member which expresses opposition of
meaning&mdash;it connects the nouns &quot;wisdom and folly.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Governs</i> is a verb, a word that signifies, &amp;c.&mdash;of the third person,
singular number, agreeing with &quot;wisdom or folly,&quot; according to
RULE 9. <i>Two or more nouns singular, joined by</i> disjunctive
<i>conjunctions, must have verbs, nouns, and pronouns agreeing with them
in the</i> singular:</p>

<p>If you reflect, for a few moments, on the meaning of me last two Rules
presented, you will see, at once, their propriety and importance. For
example; in the sentence, &quot;Orlando <i>and</i> Thomas, <i>who study their
lessons, make</i> rapid progress,&quot; you notice that the two singular nouns,
<i>Orlando</i> and <i>Thomas</i>, are connected by the copulative conjunction
<i>and</i>, therefore the verb <i>make</i>, which agrees with them, is plural,
because it expresses the action of <i>both</i> its nominatives or actors. And
you observe, too, that the pronouns <i>who</i> and <i>their</i>, and the noun
<i>lessons</i>, are <i>plural</i>, agreeing with the nouns <i>Orlando</i> and <i>Thomas</i>,
according to RULE 8. The verb <i>study</i> is plural, agreeing with <i>who</i>,
according to RULE 4.</p>

<p>But let us connect these two nouns by a disjunctive conjunction, and see
how the sentence will read: &quot;Orlando <i>or</i> Thomas, <i>who studies his
lesson, makes</i> rapid progress.&quot; Now, you perceive, that a different
construction takes place, for the latter expression does not imply, that
Orlando and Thomas, <i>both</i> study and make rapid progress; but it
asserts, that either the one <i>or</i> the other studies, and makes rapid
progress. Hence the verb <i>makes</i> is singular, because it expresses the
action of the one <i>or</i> the other of its nominatives. And you observe,
too, that the pronouns <i>who</i> and <i>his</i>, and the noun <i>lesson</i>, are
likewise in the singular, agreeing with Orlando <i>or</i> Thomas, agreeably
to RULE 9. <i>Studies</i> is also singular, agreeing with <i>who</i>, according to
RULE 4.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<p>Joseph and his brother reside in New York. The Sun, moon, and stars,
admonish us of a superior and superintending Power. I respect my friend,
because he is upright and obliging. Henry and William, who obey their
teacher, improve rapidly. Henry or William, who obeys his teacher,
improves very fast. Neither rank nor possession makes the guilty mind
happy. Wisdom, virtue, and meekness, form the good man's happiness and
interest: they support him in adversity, and comfort him in prosperity.
Man is a little lower than the angels. The United States, as justly as
Great Britain, can now boast of their literary institutions.</p>

<div class="smalltext"><p>NOTE. The verb <i>form</i> is plural, and agrees with three nouns singular,
connected by copulative conjunctions, according to RULE 8. The verb
<i>comfort</i> agrees with <i>they</i> for its nominative. It is connected to
<i>support</i> by the conjunction <i>and</i>, agreeably to RULE 34. <i>Angels</i> is
nom. to <i>are</i> understood, and <i>Great Britain</i> is nom. to <i>can boast</i>
understood, according to RULE 35.</p>

<h4>REMARKS ON CONJUNCTIONS AND PREPOSITIONS.</h4>

<p>The same word is occasionally employed, either as a conjunction, an
adverb, or a preposition. &quot;I submitted, <i>for</i> it was in vain to resist;&quot;
in this example, <i>for</i> is a conjunction, because it connects the two
members of a compound sentence. In the next it is a preposition, and
governs <i>victory</i> in the objective case: &quot;He contended <i>for</i> victory
only.&quot;</p>

<p>In the first of the following sentences, <i>since</i> is a conjunction; in
the second, it is a preposition, and in the third, an adverb; &quot;<i>Since</i>
we must part, let us do it peaceably; I have not seen him <i>since</i> that
time; Our friendship commenced long <i>since.</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will repent <i>before</i> he dies; Stand <i>before</i> me; Why did you not
return <i>before</i>&quot; [that or this <i>time</i>;] in the first of these three
examples, <i>before</i> is an adverbial conjunction, because it expresses
time and connects; and in the second and third, it is a preposition.</p>

<a name="transposition"></a>
<p>As the words of a sentence are often transposed, so are also its
members. Without attending to this circumstance, the learner may
sometimes be at a loss to perceive the <i>connecting</i> power of a
preposition or conjunction, for every preposition and every conjunction
connects either words or phrases, sentences or members of sentences.
Whenever a sentence begins with a preposition or conjunction, its
members are transposed; as, &quot;<i>In</i> the days of Joram, king of Israel,
flourished the prophet Elisha;&quot; &quot;<i>If</i> thou seek the Lord, he will be
found of thee; but, <i>if</i> thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for
ever.&quot;</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;<i>When</i> coldness wraps this suffering clay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'><i>&quot;Ah, whither strays the immortal mind?&quot;</i></span><br />

<p>That the words <i>in, if</i>, and <i>when</i>, in these examples, connect the
members of the respective sentences to which they are attached, will
obviously appear if we restore these sentences to their natural order,
and bring these particles <i>between</i> the members which they connect:
thus, &quot;Elisha the prophet flourished <i>in</i> the days of Joram, king of
Israel;&quot; &quot;The Lord will be found of thee <i>if</i> thou seek him; but he will
cast thee off for ever <i>if</i> thou forsake him:&quot;</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'><i>&quot;Ah, whither strays the immortal mind,</i></span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;<i>When</i> coldness wraps this suffering clay?&quot;</span><br />

<h4>PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES.</h4>

<p>On scientific principles, our <i>connectives</i>, commonly denominated
prepositions and conjunctions, are but one part of speech, the
distinction between them being merely technical. Some conjunctions
unite only words, and some prepositions connect sentences. They are
derived from nouns and verbs; and the time has been, when, perhaps,
in our language, they did not perform the office of connectives.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish you to believe, <i>that</i> I would not wilfully hurt a fly.&quot;
Here, in the opinion of H. Tooke, our modern conjunction <i>that</i>, is
merely a demonstrative adjective, in a disguised form; and he
attempts to prove it by the following resolution: &quot;I would not
wilfully hurt a fly. I wish you to believe <i>that [assertion</i>.&quot;] Now,
if we admit, that <i>that</i> is an adjective in the latter construction,
it does not necessarily follow, that it is the same part of speech,
nor that its associated meaning is precisely the same, in the former
construction. Instead of expressing our ideas in two detached
sentences, by the former phraseology we have a quicker and closer
transition of thought, and both the mode of employing <i>that</i>, and
its <i>inferential</i> meaning, are changed. Moreover, if we examine the
meaning of each of these constructions, taken as a whole, we shall
find, that they do not both convey the same ideas. By the latter, I
assert, positively, that &quot;I would not wilfully hurt a fly:&quot; whereas,
by the former, I merely <i>wish you to believe</i> that &quot;I would not
wilfully hurt a fly;&quot; but I do not <i>affirm</i>, that as a fact.</p>

<p><i>That</i> being the past part, of <i>thean</i>, to get, take, assume, by
rendering it as a <i>participle</i>, instead of an adjective, we should
come nearer to its primitive character. Thus, &quot;I would not wilfully
hurt a fly. I wish you to believe the <i>assumed [fact</i> or
<i>statement</i>;] or, the fact <i>assumed</i> or <i>taken</i>.&quot;</p>

<p><i><a name="If"></a>If</i>, (formerly written <i>gif, give, gin</i>,) as previously stated, is
the imperative of the Anglo-Saxon verb <i>gifan</i>, to give. In
imitation of Horne Tooke, some of our modern philosophical writers
are inclined to teach pupils to render it as a verb. Thus, &quot;I will
go, <i>if</i> he will accompany me:&quot;&mdash;&quot;He will accompany me.
<i>Grant</i>&mdash;<i>give</i> that [fact] I will go.&quot; For the purpose of
ascertaining the <i>primitive</i> meaning of this word, I have no
objection to such a resolution; but, by it, do we get the exact
meaning and force of <i>if</i> as it is applied in our modern, refined
state of the language? I <i>trow</i> not. But, admitting we do, does this
prove that such a mode of resolving sentences can be advantageously
adopted by learners in common schools? I presume it can not be
denied, that instead of teaching the learner to express himself
correctly in modern English, such a resolution is merely making him
familiar with an ancient and barbarous construction which modern
refinement has rejected. Our forefathers, I admit, who were governed
by those laws of necessity which compel all nations in the early and
rude state of their language, to express themselves in short,
detached sentences, employed <i>if</i> as a verb when they used the
following circumlocution: &quot;My son will reform. <i>Give that fact</i>. I
will forgive him.&quot; But in the present, improved state of our
language, by using <i>if</i> as a <i>conjunction</i>, (for I maintain that it
is one,) we express the same thought more briefly; and our modern
mode of expression has, too, a decisive advantage over the ancient,
not only in point of elegance, but also in perspicuity and force. In
Scotland and the north of England, some people still make use of
<i>gin</i>, a contraction of <i>given:</i> thus, &quot;I will pardon my son, <i>gin</i>
he reform.&quot; But who will contend, that they speak pure English?</p>

<p>But perhaps the advocates of what <i>they</i> call a philosophical
development of language, will say, that by their resolution of
sentences, they merely supply an ellipsis. If, by an ellipsis, they
mean such a one as is necessary, to the grammatical construction, I
cannot accede to their assumption. In teaching grammar, as well as
in other things, we ought to avoid extremes:&mdash;we ought neither to
pass superficially over an ellipsis necessary to the sense of a
phrase, nor to put modern English to the blush, by adopting a mode
of resolving sentences that would entirely change the character of
our language, and carry the learner back to the Vandalic age.</p>

<a name='as_ii'></a>
<p><i>But</i> comes from the Saxon verb, <i>beon-utan</i>, to be-out. &quot;All were
well <i>but (be-out, leave-out)</i> the stranger.&quot; &quot;Man is <i>but</i> a reed,
floating on the current of time.&quot; Resolution: &quot;Man is a reed,

<i>aned, oned</i>, or made <i>one. And</i> also refers to the thing that is

thing mentioned. &quot;Julius <i>and</i> Harriet will make a happy pair.&quot;

<p><i><a name='Because'></a>Because</i>&mdash;<i>be-cause</i>, is a compound of the verb <i>be</i>, and the noun

know it to be true;&quot; i.e. the <i>cause</i> of my belief, <i>be</i>, or <i>is</i>, I
know it to be true.</p>

<p><i>Nor</i> is a contraction of <i>ne or. Ne</i> is a contraction of <i>not</i>, and
<i>or</i>, of <i>other. Nor</i> is, <i>not other</i>-wise: <i>not</i> in the <i>other</i> way
or manner.</p>

<p><i>Else</i> is the imperative of <i>alesan, unless</i>, of <i>onlesan</i>, and

release, loosen, set free. &quot;He will be punished, <i>unless</i> he
repent;&quot;&mdash;&quot;<i>Unless, release, give up</i>, (the fact) he repents he will
be punished.&quot; <i>Though</i> is the imperative of the Saxon verb
<i>thafigan</i>, to allow, and <i>yet</i> of <i>getan</i>, to get. <i>Yet</i> is simply,
<i>get</i>; ancient <i>g</i> is the modern <i>y</i>. &quot;<i>Though</i> he slay me, <i>yet</i>
will I trust in him:&mdash;<i>Grant</i> or <i>allow</i> (the fact) he slay me,
<i>get</i>, or <i>retain</i> (the opposite fact) I will trust in
him.&quot;</p>

<h2>LECTURE X.</h2>


<h3>OF INTERJECTIONS.&mdash;CASES OF NOUNS.</h3>

<div class="bigtext"><p>INTERJECTIONS are words which express the sudden emotions of the
speaker; as, &quot;<i>Alas!</i> I fear for life;&quot; &quot;<i>O</i> death! where is thy sting?&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>Interjections are not so much the signs of thought, as of feeling.
Almost any word may be used as an interjection; but when so employed, it
is not the representative of a <i>distinct</i>, idea. A word which denotes a
distinct conception of the mind, must necessarily belong to some other
part of speech. They who wish to speak often, or rather, to make
<i>noises</i>, when they have no useful information to communicate, are apt
to use words very freely in this way; such as the following expressions,
<i>la, la me, my, O my, O dear, dear me, surprising, astonishing</i>, and the
like.</p>

<p>Interjections not included in the following list, are generally known by
their taking an exclamation point after them.</p>

<h4>A LIST OF THE PRINCIPAL INTERJECTIONS.</h4>

<ol><li>Of <i>earnestness</i> or <i>grief</i>; as, O! oh! ah! alas!</li>
<li><i>Contempt;</i> as, Pish! tush!</li>
<li><i>Wonder;</i> as, Heigh! really! strange!</li>
<li><i>Calling;</i> as, Hem! ho! halloo!</li>
<li><i>Disgust</i> or <i>aversion;</i> as, Foh! fy! fudge! away!</li>
<li><i>Attention</i>; as, Lo! behold! hark!</li>
<li><i>Requesting silence</i>; as, Hush! hist!</li>
<li><i>Salutation</i>; as, Welcome! hail! all hail!</li></ol>


<div class="smalltext"><p>NOTE. We frequently meet with what some call an <i>interjective
phrase</i>; such as, Ungrateful wretch! impudence of hope! folly in the
extreme! what ingratitude! away with him!
</p></div>

<p>As the interjection is the least important part of speech in the English
language, it will require but little attention. You may, however, make
yourself well acquainted with what has been said respecting it, and then
commit the</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;O virtue! how amiable thou art!&quot;</p>

<p><i>O</i> is an interjection, a word used to express some passion or emotion
of the speaker.</p>

<p>The ten parts of speech have now been unfolded and elucidated, although
some of them have not been fully explained. Before you proceed any
farther, you will please to begin again at the first lecture, and read
over, attentively, the whole, observing to parse every example in the
exercises systematically. You will then be able to parse the following
exercises, which contain all the parts of speech. If you study
faithfully <i>six</i> hours in a day, and pursue the directions given, you
may become, if not a critical, at least, a good, practical grammarian,
in <i>six weeks</i>; but if you study only <i>three</i> hours in a day, it will
take you nearly <i>three months</i> to acquire the same knowledge.</p>

<h4>CASES OF NOUNS.</h4>

<p>In a former lecture, I promised to give you a more extensive explanation
of the cases of nouns; and, as they are, in many situations, a little
difficult to be ascertained, I will now offer some remarks on this
subject. But before you proceed, I wish you to parse all the examples in
the exercises just presented, observing to pay particular attention to
the remarks in the subjoined NOTE. Those remarks will assist you much in
analyzing.</p>

<p>A noun is sometimes nominative to a verb placed many lines after the
noun. You must exercise your judgment in this matter. Look at the
sentence in the preceding exercises beginning with, &quot;He who, every
morning,&quot; &amp;c. and see if you can find the verb to which <i>he</i> is
nominative. What does <i>he</i> do? He carries on a thread, &amp;c. <i>He</i>, then,
is nominative to the verb <i>carries</i>. What does <i>who</i> do? Who <i>plans</i>,
and who <i>follows</i>, &amp;c. Then <i>who</i> is nom. to <i>plans</i>, and <i>who</i>
understood, is nominative to <i>follows</i>.</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;A soul without reflection, like a pile</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Without inhabitant, to ruin runs.&quot;</span><br />

<p>In order to find the verb to which the noun <i>soul</i>, in this sentence, is
the nominative, put the question; What does a <i>soul</i> without reflection
do? Such, a soul <i>runs</i> to ruin, like a pile without inhabitant. Thus
you discover, that <i>soul</i> is nominative to <i>runs</i>.</p>

<p>When the words of a sentence are arranged according to their natural
order, the nominative case, you recollect, is placed before the verb,
and the objective, after it; but when the words of a sentence are
transposed; that is, not arranged according to their natural order, it
frequently happens, that the nominative comes <i>after</i>, and the
objective, <i>before</i> the verb; especially in poetry, or when a question
is asked: as, &quot;Whence <i>arises</i> the <i>misery</i> of the present world?&quot; &quot;What
good <i>thing shall</i> I <i>do</i> to inherit eternal life?&quot; Put these
expressions in the declarative form, and the nominative will <i>precede</i>,
and the objective <i>follow</i> its verb: thus, &quot;The <i>misery</i> of the present
world <i>arises</i> whence; I <i>shall do</i> what good <i>thing</i> to inherit eternal
life.&quot;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span>&quot;Now came still <i>evening</i> on, and twilight gray</span><br />
<span>Had, in her sober livery, all <i>things</i> clad.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<div class='poem'>
<span>&quot;Stern rugged nurse, thy rigid <i>lore</i></span><br />
<span>With patience many a <i>year</i> she bore.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<p>What did the <i>evening</i> do? The evening <i>came on</i>. Gray <i>twilight</i> had
clad what? Twilight had clad all <i>things</i> in her sober livery.
<i>Evening</i>, then, is nom. to <i>came</i>, and the noun <i>things</i> is in the
objective case, and gov. by <i>had clad</i>: RULE 20. What did <i>she</i> bear?
She bore thy rigid <i>lore</i> with patience, <i>for</i>, or <i>during</i>, many a
year. Hence you find, that <i>lore</i> is in the objective case, and governed
by <i>bore</i>, according to RULE 20. <i>Year</i> is gov. by <i>during</i> understood:
RULE 32.</p>

<p>A noun is frequently nominative to a verb understood, or in the
objective, and governed by a verb understood; as, &quot;Lo, [<i>there is</i>] the
poor <i>Indian!</i> whose untutored mind.&quot; &quot;O, the <i>pain</i> [<i>there is!</i>] the
<i>bliss</i> [<i>there is</i>] in dying!&quot; &quot;All were sunk, but the wakeful
<i>nightingale</i> [<i>was not sunk</i>.&quot;] &quot;He thought as a <i>sage</i> [<i>thinks</i>,]
though he felt as a <i>man</i> [<i>feels</i>.&quot;] &quot;His hopes, immortal, blow them
by, as <i>dust</i> [<i>is blown by</i>.&quot;] Rule 35 applies to these last three
examples.</p>

<p>In the next place I will explain several cases of nouns and pronouns
which have not yet come under our notice. Sometimes a noun or pronoun
may be in the nominative case when it has no verb to agree with it.</p>

<a name="nominative_case_independent_ii"></a>
<h4>OF THE NOMINATIVE CASE INDEPENDENT.</h4>

<div class="bigtext"><p>Whenever a direct address is made, the person or thing spoken to, is in
the <i>nominative case independent</i>; as, &quot;<i>James</i>, I desire you to study.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>You notice that, in this expression, I address myself to <i>James</i> that
is, I speak to him; and you observe, too, that there is no verb, either
expressed or implied, to which James can be the nominative; therefore
you know that <i>James</i> is in the nom. case independent, according to Rule
5. Recollect, that <i>whenever a noun is of the second person</i>, it is in
the nom. case independent; that is, independent of any verb; as,
<i>Selma</i>, thy halls are silent; Love and meekness, my <i>lord</i>, become a
churchman, better than ambition; O <i>Jerusalem, Jerusalem</i>, how often
would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her
chickens under her wings, but ye would not!&mdash;For a farther illustration
of this case, see Note 2, under the 5th Rule of Syntax.</p>

<div class="smalltext"><p>NOTE. When a pronoun of the <i>second</i> person is in apposition with a
noun independent, it is in the same case; as, &quot;<i>Thou traitor</i>, I
detest thee.&quot;
</p></div>
<a name="NOMINATIVE_CASE_ABSOLUTE_i"></a>
<h4>OF THE NOMINATIVE CASE ABSOLUTE.</h4>

<div class="bigtext"><p>A noun or pronoun placed before a participle, without any verb to agree
with it, is in the nominative case <i>absolute</i>; as, &quot;The <i>sun being
risen</i>, we pursued our journey.&quot;</p></div>

<p><i>Sun</i> is here placed before the participle &quot;being risen,&quot; and has no
verb to agree with it; therefore it is in the nominative case absolute,
according to RULE 6.</p>

<div class="smalltext"><p>NOTE 1. A noun or pronoun in the nominative case independent, is always
of the <i>second</i> person; but, in the case absolute, it is generally of
the <i>third</i> person.</p>

<p>2. The case absolute is always nominative; the following sentence is
therefore incorrect; &quot;Whose top shall tremble, <i>him</i> descending,&quot; &amp;c.;
it should be, <i>he</i> descending.</p>
</div>

<a name="APPOSITION_i"></a>
<h4>OF NOUNS IN APPOSITION.</h4>

<div class="bigtext"><p>Two or more nouns or pronouns signifying the same person or thing, are
put, by <i>apposition</i>, in the same case; as, &quot;<i>Cicero</i>, the great
<i>orator, philosopher</i>, and <i>statesman</i> of Rome, was murdered by Antony.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p><i>Apposition</i>, in a grammatical sense, means something added, or names
added, in order more fully to define or illustrate the sense of the
first name mentioned.</p>

<p>You perceive that <i>Cicero</i>, in the preceding example, is merely the
proper name of a man; but when I give him the three additional
appellations, and call him a great <i>orator, philosopher</i>, and
<i>statesman</i>, you understand what kind of a man he was; that is, by
giving him these three additional names, his character and abilities as
a man are more fully made known. And, surely, you cannot be at a loss to
know that these four nouns must be in the same case, for they are all
names given to the same person; therefore, if <i>Cicero</i> was murdered, the
<i>orator</i> was murdered, and the <i>philosopher</i> was murdered, and the
<i>statesman</i> was murdered, because they all mean one and the same person.</p>

<p>Nouns and pronouns in the objective case, are frequently in
<i>apposition</i>; as, He struck <i>Charles</i> the <i>student</i>. Now it is obvious,
that, when he struck <i>Charles</i>, he struck the <i>student</i>, because Charles
was the <i>student</i>, and the <i>student</i> was <i>Charles</i>; therefore the noun
<i>student</i> is in the objective case, governed by &quot;struck,&quot; and put by
apposition with Charles, according to RULE 7.</p>

<h4>PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext"><p>The term INTERJECTION is applied to those <i>inarticulate</i> sounds
employed both by men and brutes, not to express distinct ideas, but
emotions, passions, or feelings. The sounds employed by human beings
in groaning, sighing, crying, screaming, shrieking, and laughing, by
the dog in barking, growling, and whining, by the horse in snorting
and neighing, by the sheep in bleating, by the cat in mewing, by the
dove in cooing, by the duck in quacking, and by the goose in
hissing, we sometimes attempt to represent by words; but, as
<i>written</i> words are the ocular representatives of <i>articulate</i>
sounds, they cannot be made clearly to denote <i>inarticulate</i> or
<i>indistinct noises</i>. Such indistinct utterances belong to natural
language; but they fall below the bounds of regulated speech. Hence,
<i>real</i> interjections are not a part of written language.</p>

<p>The meaning of those words commonly called interjections, is easily
shown by tracing them to their roots.</p>

<p><i>Pish</i> and <i>pshaw</i> are the Anglo-Saxon <i>paec, paeca</i>; and are
equivalent to <i>trumpery</i>! i.e. <i>tromperie</i>, from <i>tromper</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fy</i> or <i>fie</i> is the imperative, <i>foe</i>, the past tense, and <i>foh</i> or
<i>faugh</i>, the past part. of the Saxon verb <i>fian</i>, to hate.
<i>Lo</i> is the imperative of <i>look. Halt</i> is the imperative of
<i>healden</i>, to hold. <i>Farewell&mdash;fare-well</i>, is a compound of <i>faran</i>,
to go, and the adverb <i>well</i>. It means, to <i>go well.
Welcome&mdash;well-come</i>, signifies, it is <i>well</i> that you are <i>come.
Adieu</i> comes from the French <i>a Dieu</i>, to God; meaning, I commend
you <i>to God</i>.</p>

<h2>LECTURE XI.</h2>


<h3>OF THE MOODS AND TENSES OF VERBS.</h3>

<p>You have now acquired a general, and, I may say, an extensive, knowledge
of nine parts of speech; but you know but little, as yet, respecting the
most important one of all; I mean the VERB. I will, therefore, commence
this lecture by giving you an explanation of the Moods and Tenses of
verbs. Have the goodness, however, first to turn back and read over
Lecture II., and reflect well upon what is there said respecting the
verb; after which I will conduct you so smoothly through the moods and
tenses, and the conjugation of verbs, that, instead of finding yourself
involved in obscurities and deep intricacies, you will scarcely find an
obstruction to impede your progress.</p>

<a name="MOODS"></a>
<h4>I. OF THE MOODS.</h4>

<div class="bigtext">
<p>The MOOD or MODE of a verb means the <i>manner</i> in which its action,
passion, or being, is represented.</p>
</div>

<p>When I wish to assert a thing, positively, I use the <i>declarative</i> or
<i>indicative</i> mode; as, The man <i>walks</i>; but sometimes the action or
occurrence of which I wish to speak, is doubtful, and then I must not
declare it positively, but I must adopt another <i>mode</i> of expression;
thus, <i>If</i> the man <i>walk</i>, he will refresh himself with the bland
breezes. This second mode or manner of representing the action, is
called the <i>subjunctive</i> or <i>conditional</i> mode.</p>

<p>Again, we sometimes employ a verb when we do not wish to <i>declare</i> a
thing, nor to represent the action in a <i>doubtful</i> or <i>conditional</i>
manner; but we wish to <i>command</i> some one to act. We then use the
<i>imperative</i> or <i>commanding</i> mode, and say, <i>Walk</i>, sir. And when we do
not wish to command a man to act, we sometimes allude to his <i>power</i> or
<i>ability</i> to act. This fourth mode of representing action, is called the
<i>potential</i> mode; as, He <i>can walk</i>; He <i>could walk</i>. The fifth and last
mode, called the <i>infinitive</i> or <i>unlimited</i> mode, we employ in
expressing action in an unlimited manner; that is, without confining it,
in respect to number and person, to any particular agent; as, <i>To walk,
to ride</i>. Thus you perceive, that the mood, mode, or manner of
representing the action, passion, or being of a verb, must vary
according to the different intentions of the mind.</p>

<p>Were we to assign a particular name to <i>every</i> change in the mode or
manner of representing action or being, the number of moods in our
language would amount to many hundreds. But this principle of division
and arrangement, if followed out in detail, would lead to great
perplexity, without producing any beneficial result. The division of Mr.
Harris, in his Hermes, is much more curious than instructive. He has
fourteen moods; his <i>interrogative, optative, hortative, promissive,
precautive, requisitive, enunciative</i>, &amp;c. But as far as philosophical
accuracy and the convenience and advantage of the learner are concerned,
it is believed that no arrangement is preferable to the following. I am
not unaware that plausible objections may be raised against it; but what
arrangement cannot be objected to?</p>

<div class="bigtext"><p>There are five moods of verbs, the Indicative, the Subjunctive, the
Imperative, the Potential, and the Infinitive.</p>

<p>The INDICATIVE MOOD simply indicates or declares a thing; as, &quot;He
<i>writes</i>;&quot; or it asks a question; as, &quot;<i>Does</i> he <i>write</i>? Who <i>wrote</i>
that?&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>The term <i>indicative</i>, comes from the Latin <i>indico</i>, to <i>declare</i>.
Hence, the legitimate province of the indicative mood, is to <i>declare</i>
things, whether positively or negatively; thus, <i>positively</i>, He <i>came</i>
with me; <i>negatively</i>, He <i>came not</i> with me. But in order to avoid a
multiplication of moods, we extend its meaning, and use the indicative
mood in asking a question; as, Who <i>came</i> with you?</p>

<p>The subjunctive mood being more analogous to the indicative in
conjugation, than any other, it ought to be presented next in order.
This mood, however, differs materially from the indicative in sense;
therefore you ought to make yourself well acquainted with the nature of
the indicative, before you commence with the subjunctive.</p>

<div class="bigtext"><p>The <a name="SUBJUNCTIVE_i"></a>SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD expresses action, passion, or being, in a doubtful
or conditional manner or,</p>

<p>When a verb is preceded by a word that expresses a condition, doubt,
motive, wish, or supposition, it is in the SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD; as, &quot;<i>If</i>
he <i>study</i>, he will improve; I will respect him, <i>though</i> he <i>chide</i> me;
He will not be pardoned, <i>unless</i> he <i>repent</i>; <i>Had</i> he <i>been</i> there, he
would have conquered;&quot; (that is, <i>if</i> he <i>had been</i> there.)</p>
</div>

<p>The conjunctions <i>if, though, unless</i>, in the preceding examples,
express condition, doubt, &amp;c.; therefore, the verbs <i>study, chide,
repent</i>, and <i>had been</i>, are in the subjunctive mood.</p>

<div class="smalltext"><p>NOTE 1. A verb in this mood is generally attended by another verb in
some other mood. You observe, that each of the first three of the
preceding examples, contains a verb in the indicative mood, and the
fourth, a verb in the potential.</p>

<p>2. Whenever the conjunctions <i>if, though, unless, except, whether,</i>
<i>lest</i>, or any others, denote contingency or doubt, the verbs that
follow them are in the subjunctive mood; as, &quot;<i>If</i> he <i>ride</i> out
every day, his health will probably improve;&quot; that is, if he <i>shall</i>
or <i>should</i> ride out hereafter. But when these conjunctions do not
imply doubt, &amp;c. the verbs that follow them are in the indicative,
or some other mood; as, &quot;<i>Though</i> he <i>rides</i> out daily, his health
is no better.&quot; The conjunctive and indicative forms of this mood,
are explained in the conjugation of the verb to <i>love</i>. See page.</p>
</div>

<div class="bigtext"><p>The IMPERATIVE MOOD is used for commanding, exhorting, entreating, or
permitting; as, <i>&quot;Depart</i> thou; <i>Remember</i> my admonitions; <i>Tarry</i>
awhile longer; <i>Go</i> in peace.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>The verb <i>depart</i> expresses a command; <i>remember</i> exhorts; <i>tarry</i>
expresses entreaty; and <i>go</i>, permission; therefore they are all in the
imperative mood.</p>

<p>The <i>imperative</i>, from <i>impero</i>, to command, is literally that mood of
the verb used in <i>commanding;</i> but its technical meaning in grammar is
extended to the use of the verb in exhorting, entreating, and
permitting.</p>

<p>A verb in the imperative mood, is always of the second person, though
never varied in its terminations, agreeing with <i>thou, ye</i>, or <i>you</i>,
either expressed or implied. You may know a verb in this mood by the
sense; recollect, however, that the nominative is always <i>second</i>
person, and frequently understood; as, George, <i>give</i> me my hat; that
is, give thou, or give you. When the nominative is expressed, it is
generally placed after the verb; as, Go <i>thou</i>; Depart <i>ye</i>; or between
the auxiliary and the verb; as, Do <i>thou</i> go; Do <i>ye</i> depart. (<i>Do</i> is
the auxiliary.)</p>

<div class="bigtext"><p>The POTENTIAL MOOD implies possibility, liberty, or necessity, power,
will, or obligation; as, &quot;It <i>may rain</i>; He <i>may go</i> or <i>stay</i>; We <i>must
eat</i> and <i>drink</i>; I <i>can ride</i>; He <i>would walk</i>; They <i>should learn</i>.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>In the first of these examples, the auxiliary <i>may</i> implies possibility;
in the second it implies liberty; that is, he is at liberty to go or to
stay; in the third, <i>must</i> denotes necessity; <i>can</i> denotes power or
ability; <i>would</i> implies will or inclination; that is, he had a <i>mind</i>
to walk; and <i>should</i> implies obligation. Hence you perceive, that the
verbs, may rain, may go, must eat, must drink, can ride, world walk, and
should learn, are in the <i>potential</i> mood.</p>

<div class="smalltext"><p>NOTE 1. As a verb in the indicative mood is converted into the
subjunctive when it is preceded by a conjunction expressing doubt,
contingency, supposition, &amp;c., so a verb in the potential mood, may,
in like manner, be turned into the subjunctive; as, &quot;<i>If</i> I <i>could
deceive</i> him, I should abhor it; <i>Though</i> he <i>should increase</i> in
wealth, he would not be charitable.&quot; I <i>could deceive</i>, is in the
potential; <i>If</i> I <i>could deceive</i>, is in the subjunctive mood.</p>

<p>2. The potential mood, as well as the indicative, is used in asking
a question; as, &quot;May I go? Could you understand him? Must we die?&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="bigtext"><p>The INFINITIVE MOOD expresses action, passion, or being, in a general
and unlimited manner, having no nominative, consequently, neither person
nor number; as, <i>&quot;To speak, to walk</i>.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p><i>Infinitive</i> means <i>unconfined</i>, or <i>unlimited</i>. This mood is called the
infinitive, because its verb is not confined or limited to a nominative.
A verb in any other mood is limited; that is, it must agree in number
and person with its nominative; but a verb in this mood has <i>no</i>
nominative, therefore, it never changes its termination, except to form
the perfect tense. Now you understand why all verbs are called <i>finite</i>
or <i>limited</i>, excepting those in the infinitive mood.</p>

<div class="smalltext"><p>NOTE. <i>To</i>, the sign of the infinitive mood, is often understood
before the verb; as, &quot;Let me proceed;&quot; that is, Let me <i>to</i> proceed.
See RULE 25. <i>To</i> is not a preposition when joined to a verb in this
mood; thus, <i>to</i> ride, <i>to</i> rule; but it should be parsed with the
verb, and as a part of it.
</p></div>
<p>If you study this lecture attentively, you will perceive, that when I
say, I <i>write</i>, the verb is in the indicative mood; but when I say, <i>if</i>
I write, or, <i>unless</i> I write, &amp;c. the verb is in the subjunctive mood;
<i>write</i> thou, or <i>write</i> ye or you, the imperative; I <i>may write</i>, I
<i>must write</i>, I <i>could write, &amp;c.</i> the potential; and <i>to write</i>, the
infinitive. Any other verb (except the defective) may be employed in the
same manner.</p>

<a name="TENSES_i"></a>
<h4>II. OF THE TENSES.</h4>

<div class="bigtext"><p>TENSE means time.</p>

<p>Verbs have six tenses, the Present, the Imperfect, the Perfect, the
Pluperfect, and the First and Second Future tenses.</p>

<p>The PRESENT TENSE represents an action or event as taking place at the
time in which it is mentioned; as, &quot;I <i>smile</i>; I <i>see</i>; I <i>am seen</i>.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="smalltext"><p>NOTE 1. The present tense is also used in speaking of actions
continued, with occasional intermissions, to the present time; as,
&quot;He <i>rides</i> out every morning.&quot;</p>

<p>2. This tense is sometimes applied to represent the actions of
persons long since dead; as, &quot;Seneca <i>reasons</i> and <i>moralizes</i> well;
An honest man <i>is</i> the noblest work of God.&quot;</p>

<p>3. When the present tense is preceded by the words, <i>when, before,</i>
<i>after, as soon as</i>, &amp;c. it is sometimes used to point out the
relative time of a future action; as, &quot;<i>When</i> he <i>arrives</i> we shall
hear the news.&quot;</p></div>

<div class="bigtext"><p>The IMPERFECT TENSE denotes a past action or event, however distant;
or,</p>

<p>The IMPERFECT TENSE represents an action or event as past and finished,
but without defining the precise time of its completion; as, &quot;I <i>loved</i>
her for her modesty and virtue; They <i>were</i> travelling post when he
<i>met</i> them.&quot;</p></div>

<p>In these examples, the verbs <i>loved</i> and <i>met</i> express past and
<i>finished</i> actions, and therefore constitute a <i>perfect</i> tense as
strictly as any form of the verb in our language; but, as they do not
define the precise time of the completion of these actions, their tense
may properly be denominated an <i>indefinite past</i>. By defining the
present participle in conjunction with the verb, we have an <i>imperfect</i>
tense in the expression, <i>were travelling</i>. This course, however, would
not be in accordance with the ordinary method of treating the
participle. Hence it follows, that the terms <i>imperfect</i> and <i>perfect</i>,
as applied to this and the next succeeding tense, are not altogether
significant of their true character; but if you learn to apply these
tenses <i>correctly</i>, the propriety or impropriety of their names is not a
consideration of very great moment.</p>

<div class="bigtext"><p>The PERFECT TENSE denotes past time, and also conveys an allusion to the
present; as, &quot;I <i>have</i> finished my letter.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>The verb <i>have finished</i>, in this example, signifies that the action,
though past, was perfectly finished at a point of time immediately
preceding, or in the course of a period which comes to the present.
Under this view of the subject, the term <i>perfect</i> may be properly
applied to this tense, for it specifies, not only the completion of the
action, but, also, alludes to the particular period of its
accomplishment.</p>

<div class="bigtext"><p>The PLUPERFECT TENSE represents a past action or event that transpired
before some other past time specified; as, &quot;I <i>had finished</i> my letter
before my brother arrived.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>You observe that the verb <i>had finished</i>, in this example, represents
one <i>past</i> action, and the arrival of my brother, another <i>past</i> action;
therefore <i>had finished</i> is in the pluperfect tense, because the action
took place prior to the taking place of the other past action specified
in the same sentence.</p>

<div class="bigtext"><p>The FIRST FUTURE TENSE denotes a future action or event; as &quot;I <i>will
finish</i>; I <i>shall finish</i> my letter.&quot;</p>

<p>The SECOND FUTURE TENSE represents a future action that will be fully
accomplished, at or before the time of another future action or event;
as, &quot;I <i>shall have finished</i> my letter when my brother arrives.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>This example clearly shows you the meaning and the proper use of the
second future tense. The verb &quot;shall have finished&quot; implies a future
action that will be completely finished, at or before the time of the
other future event denoted by the phrase, &quot;<i>when</i> my brother <i>arrives</i>.&quot;</p>

<div class="smalltext"><p>NOTE. What is sometimes called the <i>Inceptive</i> future, is expressed
thus, &quot;I am going <i>to write</i>;&quot; &quot;I am about <i>to write</i>.&quot; Future time
is also indicated by placing the infinitive present immediately
after the indicative present of the verb <i>to be</i>; thus, &quot;I am <i>to
write</i>;&quot; &quot;Harrison is <i>to be</i>, or ought <i>to be</i>, commander in
chief;&quot; &quot;Harrison is <i>to command</i> the army.&quot;
</p></div>

<p>You may now read what is said respecting the moods and tenses several
times over, and then you may learn to <i>conjugate</i> a verb. But, before
you proceed to the conjugation of verbs, you will please to commit the
following paragraph on the <i>Auxiliary</i> verbs and, also, the <i>signs</i> of
the moods and tenses; and, in conjugating, you must pay particular
attention to the manner in which these signs are applied.</p>

<h4>OF THE <a name="AUXILIARY_VERBS"></a>AUXILIARY VERBS.</h4>

<div class="bigtext"><p>AUXILIARY or HELPING VERBS are those by the help of which the English
verbs are principally conjugated. <i>May, can, must, might, could, would,
should,</i> and <i>shall</i>, are always auxiliaries; <i>do, be, have</i>, and
<i>will</i>, are sometimes auxiliaries, and sometimes principal verbs.</p>

<p>This display of the verb shows you, in the clearest light, the
application of the <i>signs</i> of the <i>tenses</i>, which signs ought to be
perfectly committed to memory before you proceed any farther. By looking
again at the conjugation, you will notice, that <i>have</i>, placed before
the perfect participle of any verb, forms the perfect tense; <i>had</i>, the
pluperfect; <i>shall</i> or <i>will</i>, the first future, and so on.</p>

<p>Now speak each of the verbs, <i>love, hate, walk, smile, rule</i>, and
<i>conquer</i>, in the first person of each tense in this mood, with the
pronoun <i>I</i> before it; thus, indicative mood, pres. tense, first pers.
sing. I love; imperf. I loved; perf. I have loved; and so on, through
all the tenses. If you learn thoroughly the conjugation of the verb in
the indicative mood, you will find no difficulty in conjugating it
through those that follow, for in the conjugation through all the moods,
there is a great similarity.</p>

<tr><td align='left'>3. If he love.</td><td align='left'>3. If they love.</td></tr></table>


<p>Look again at the conjugation in the indicative present, and you will
observe, that the form of the verb differs from this form in the
subjunctive. The verb in the present tense of this mood, does not vary
its termination on account of number or person. This is called the
<i>conjunctive</i> form of the verb; but sometimes the verb in the
subjunctive mood, present tense, is conjugated in the same manner as it
is in the indicative, with this exception, <i>if, though, unless</i>, or some
other conjunction, is prefixed; as,</p>

<p style='text-align: center'><i>Indicative form</i>.</p>

<tr><td align='left'>3. If he loves,</td><td align='left'>3. If they love.</td></tr></table>


<p>The following general rule will direct you when to use the <i>conjunctive</i>
form of the verb, and when the <i>indicative</i>. When a verb in the
subjunctive mood, present tense, has a <i>future</i> signification, or a
reference to <i>future</i> time, the conjunctive form should be used; as, &quot;If
thou <i>prosper</i>, thou shouldst be thankful;&quot; &quot;He will maintain his
principles, though he <i>lose</i> his estate;&quot; that is, If thou <i>shalt</i> or
<i>shouldst</i> prosper; though he <i>shall</i> or <i>should</i> lose, &amp;c. But when a
verb in the subjunctive mood, present tense, has <i>no</i> reference to
future time, the indicative form ought to be used; as, &quot;Unless he
<i>means</i> what he says, he is doubly faithless.&quot; By this you perceive,
that when a verb in the present tense of the subjunctive mood, has a
future signification, an <i>auxiliary</i> is always understood before it, for
which reason, in this construction, the termination of the principal
verb never varies; us, &quot;He will not become eminent, unless he <i>exert</i>
himself;&quot; that is, unless he <i>shall</i> exert, or <i>should</i> exert himself.
This tense of the subjunctive mood ought to be called the <i>elliptical
future</i>.</p>

<p>The imperfect, the perfect, the pluperfect, and the first future tenses
of this mood, are conjugated, in every respect, like the same tenses of
the indicative, with this exception; in the subjunctive mood, a
conjunction implying doubt, &amp;c. is prefixed to the verb. In the second
future tense of this mood, the verb is conjugated thus:</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>Second Future Tense.</p>

<tr><td align='left'>3. If he shall have loved.</td><td align='left'>3. If they shall have loved.</td></tr></table>

<p>For your encouragement, allow me to inform you, that when you shall have

direction, you can, in a very short time, learn to conjugate any verb.
Conjugate the verb <i>love</i> through all the moods and tenses, in the first
person singular, with the pronoun <i>I</i> before it, and speak the
Participles: thus, Indicative mood, pres. tense, first pers. sing. I
<i>love</i>, imperf. tense, I <i>loved</i>; perf. tense, I <i>have loved</i>; and so
on, through every mood and tense. Then conjugate it in the second pers.
sing, with the pronoun <i>thou</i> before it, through all the moods and
tenses; thus, Indic. mood, pres. tense, second pers. sing, thou
<i>lovest</i>; imperf. tense, thou <i>lovedst</i>; and so on, through the whole.
After that, conjugate it in the third pers. sing, with <i>he</i> before it;
and then in the first pers. plural, with <i>we</i> before it, in like manner
through all the moods and tenses. Although this mode of procedure may,
at first, appear to be laborious, yet, as it is necessary, I trust you
will not hesitate to adopt it. My confidence in your perseverance,
induces me to recommend any course which I know will tend to facilitate
your progress.</p>

<p>When you shall have complied with my requisition, you may conjugate the
following verbs in the same manner; which will enable you, hereafter, to
tell the mood and tense of any verb without hesitation: <i>walk, hate,
smile, rule, conquer, reduce, relate, melt, shun, fail</i>.</p>

<h4>PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES.</h4>

<div class="smalltext"><p>The changes in the <a name="terminations_v"></a>termination of words, in all languages, have been
formed by the <i>coalescence</i> of words of appropriate meaning. This
subject was approached on page 49. It is again taken up for the
purpose of showing, that the moods and tenses, as well as the number
and person, of English verbs, do not solely depend on inflection.</p>

<p>The coalescing syllables which form the number and person of the
Hebrew verb, are still considered pronouns; and, by those who have
investigated the subject, it is conceded, that the same plan has
been adopted in the formation of the Latin and Greek verbs, as in
the Hebrew. Some languages have carried this process to a very great
extent. Ours is remarkable for the small number of its inflections.
But they who reject the passive verb, and those moods and tenses
which are formed by employing what are called &quot;auxiliary verbs,&quot;
<i>because they are formed of two or more verbs</i>, do not appear to
reason soundly. It is inconsistent to admit, that walk-<i>eth</i>, and
walk-<i>ed</i>, are tenses, because each is but one word, and to reject
<i>have</i> walked, and <i>will</i> walk, as tenses, because each is composed
of two words. <i>Eth</i>, as previously shown, is a contraction of
<i>doeth</i>, or <i>haveth</i>, and <i>ed</i>, of <i>dede, dodo, doed</i>, or <i>did</i>;
and, therefore, walk-<i>eth</i>; i.e. walk-<i>doeth</i>, or <i>doeth</i>-walk, and
walk-<i>ed</i>; i.e. walk-<i>did</i>, or <i>doed</i> or <i>did</i>-walk, are, when
analyzed, as strictly compound, as <i>will</i> walk, <i>shall</i> walk, and
<i>have</i> walked. The only difference in the formation of these tenses,
is, that in the two former, the associated verbs have been
contracted and made to coalesce with the main verb, but in the two
latter, they still maintain their ground as separate words.</p>

<p>If it be said that <i>will walk</i> is composed of two words, each of
which conveys a distinct idea, and, therefore, should be analyzed by
itself, the same argument with all its force, may be applied to
walk-<i>eth</i>, walk-<i>ed</i>, walk-<i>did</i>, or <i>did</i> walk. The result of all
the investigations of this subject, appears to settle down into the
hackneyed truism, that the passive verbs, and the moods and tenses,
of some languages, are formed by inflections, or terminations either
prefixed or postfixed, and of other languages, by the association of
auxiliary verbs, which have not yet been contracted and made to
coalesce as <i>terminations</i>. The auxiliary, when contracted into a
<i>terminating syllable,</i> retains its distinct and intrinsic meaning,
as much as when associated with a verb by juxtaposition:
consequently, an &quot;auxiliary verb&quot; may form a part of a mood or
tense, or passive verb, with as much propriety as a <i>terminating</i>
<i>syllable</i>. They who contend for the ancient custom of keeping the
auxiliaries distinct, and parsing them as primary verbs, are, by the
same principle, bound to extend their dissecting-knife <i>to every</i>
<i>compound word in the language</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus attempted briefly to prove the philosophical accuracy of
the theory which recognises the tenses, moods, and passive verbs,
formed by the aid of auxiliaries, I shall now offer one argument to
show that this theory, and this <i>only</i>, will subserve the purposes
of the practical grammarian.</p>

<p>As it is not so much the province of philology to instruct in the
exact meaning of single and separate words, as it is to teach the
student to combine and employ them properly in framing sentences,
and as those <i>combinations</i> which go by the name of compound tenses
and passive verbs, are necessary in writing and discourse, it
follows, conclusively, that that theory which does not explain these
verbs in their <i>combined</i> state, cannot teach the student the
correct use and application of the verbs of our language. By such an
arrangement, he cannot learn when it is proper to use the phrases,
<i>shall have walked, might have gone, have seen</i>, instead of, <i>shall
walk, might go</i>, and <i>saw</i>; because this theory has nothing to do
with the combining of verbs. If it be alleged, that the speaker or
writer's own good sense must guide him in combining these verbs,
and, therefore, that the directions of the grammarian are
unnecessary, it must be recollected, that such an argument would
bear, equally, against every principle of grammar whatever. In
short, the theory of the compound tenses, and of the passive verb,
appears to be so firmly based in the genius of our language, and so
practically important to the student, as to defy all the engines of
the paralogistic speculator, and the philosophical quibbler, to
batter it down.</p>

<p>But the most plausible objection to the old theory is, that it is
encumbered with much useless technicality and tedious prolixity,
which are avoided by the <i>simple</i> process of exploding the passive
verb, and reducing the number of the moods to three, and of the
tenses to two. It is certain, however, that if we reject the <i>names</i>
of the perfect, pluperfect, and future tenses, the <i>names</i> of the
potential and subjunctive moods, and of the passive verb, in writing
and discourse we must still employ those <i>verbal combinations</i> which
form them; and it is equally certain, that the proper mode of
employing such combinations, is as easily taught or learned by the
old theory, which <i>names</i> them, as by the new, which gives them <i>no
name</i>.</p>

<p>On philosophical principles, we might, perhaps, dispense with the
<i>future</i> tenses of the verb, by analyzing each word separately; but,
as illustrated on page 79, the combined words which form our perfect
and pluperfect tenses have an <i>associated</i> meaning, which is
destroyed by analyzing each word separately. That arrangement,
therefore, which rejects these tenses, appears to be, not only
<i>unphilosophical</i>, but inconsistent and inaccurate.</p>

<p>For the satisfaction of those teachers who prefer it, and for their
adoption, too, a modernized <i>philosophical</i> theory of the moods and
tenses is here presented. If it is not quite so convenient and
useful as the old one, they need not hesitate to adopt it. It has
the advantage of being <i>new</i>; and, moreover, it sounds <i>large</i>, and
will make the <i>commonalty stare</i>. Let it be distinctly understood,
that you teach <i>&quot;philosophical grammar, founded on reason and common</i>
<i>sense</i>,&quot; and you will pass for a very learned man, and make all the
good housewives wonder at the rapid march of intellect, and the vast
improvements of the age.</p>

<h5>MOOD.</h5>

<p>Verbs have three moods, the indicative, (embracing what is commonly
included under the <i>indicative</i>, the <i>subjunctive</i>, and the
<i>potential</i>,) the imperative, and the infinitive.&mdash;For definitions,
refer to the body of the work.</p>

<h5>TENSE OR TIME.</h5>

<p>Verbs have only two tenses, the present and the past. A verb
expressing action commenced and not completed, is in the present
tense; as, &quot;Religion <i>soars</i>: it <i>has</i> gained many victories: it
<i>will</i> [to] <i>carry</i> its votaries to the blissful regions.&quot;</p>

<p>When a verb expresses finished action, it is in the past tense; as,
&quot;This page (the Bible) God <i>hung</i> out of heaven, and <i>retired</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>A verb in the imperative and infinitive moods, is always in the
<i>present</i> tense, high authorities to the contrary notwithstanding.
The <i>command</i> must <i>necessarily</i> be given in time present, although
its <i>fulfilment</i> must be future. John, what are you doing? Learning
my task. Why do you learn it? Because my preceptor <i>commanded</i> me to
do so. When <i>did</i> he command you? <i>Yesterday</i>.&mdash;Not <i>now</i>, of
course.</p>

<p>That it is inconsistent with the nature of things for a command to
be given in <i>future</i> time, and that the <i>fulfilment</i> of the command,
though future, has nothing to do with the tense or time of the
command itself, are truths so plain as to put to the blush the gross
absurdity of those who identify the time of the fulfilment with
that of the command.</p>

<div class="smalltext"><p>In familiar writing and discourse, the following, and some other verbs,
are often improperly terminated by <i>t</i> instead of <i>ed</i>; as, &quot;learnt,
spelt, spilt, stopt, latcht.&quot; They should be, &quot;learned, spelled, spilled,
stopped, latched.&quot;</p></div>

<p>You may now conjugate the following irregular verbs, in a manner similar
to the conjugation of regular verbs: <i>arise, begin, bind, do, go, grow,
run, lend, teach, write</i>. Thus, to <i>arise</i>&mdash;Indicative mood, pres.
tense, first person, sing. I arise; imperf. tense, I arose; perf. tense,
I have arisen, and so on, through all the moods, and all the tenses of
each mood; and then speak the participles: thus, pres. arising, perf.
arisen, comp. having arisen. In the next place, conjugate the same verb
in the second person sing. through all the moods and tenses; and then in
the third person sing. and in the first pers. plural. After that, you
may proceed in the same manner with the words <i>begin, bind</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now read the eleventh and twelfth lectures <i>four</i> or <i>five</i> times over,
and learn the order of parsing a verb. You will then be prepared to
parse the following verbs in full; and I presume, all the other parts of
speech. Whenever you parse, you must refer to the Compendium for
definitions and rules, if you cannot repeat them without, I will now
parse a verb, and describe all its properties by applying the
definitions and rules according to the systematic order.</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>&quot;We <i>could</i> not <i>accomplish</i> the business.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Could accomplish</i> is a verb, a word which signifies to do&mdash;active, it
expresses action&mdash;transitive, the action passes over from the nom. &quot;we&quot;
to the object &quot;business&quot;&mdash;regular, it will form its imperfect tense of
the indic. mood and perf. part, in <i>ed</i>&mdash;potential mood, it implies
possibility or power&mdash;imperfect tense, it denotes past time however
distant&mdash;first pers. plural, because the nom. &quot;we&quot; is with which it
agrees, agreeably to RULE 4. <i>A verb must agree</i>, &amp;c. Conjugated&mdash;Indic.
mood, present tense, first pers. sing. I accomplish; imperfect tense, I
accomplished; perfect, I have accomplished; pluperfect, I had
accomplished; and so on.&mdash;Speak it in the person of each tense through
all the moods, and conjugate, in the same manner, every verb you parse.</p>

<h4>EXERCISES IN PARSING.</h4>

<div class="smalltext"><p style='text-align: center'><i>These exercises contain a complete variety of Moods and Tenses</i>.</p></div>

<p>I learn my lesson well. Charles, thou learnest thy lesson badly. John,
do you write a good hand? Those ladies wrote a beautiful letter, but
they did not despatch it. Have you seen the gentleman to whom I gave the
book? He has gone. They had received the news before the messenger
arrived. When will those persons return? My friend shall receive his
reward. He will have visited me three times, if he come to-morrow.</p>

<p>If Eliza study diligently, she will improve. If Charles studies he does
not improve. Unless that man shall have accomplished his work, by
midsummer, he will receive no wages. Orlando, obey my precepts, unless
you wish to injure yourself. Remember what is told you. The physician
may administer the medicine, but Providence only can bless it. I told,
him that he might go, but he would not. He might have gone last week,
had he conducted himself properly; (that is, <i>if he had conducted</i>, &amp;c.)
Boys, prepare to recite your lessons. Young ladies, let me hear you
repeat what you have learned. Study, diligently, whatever task may be
allotted to you. To correct the spirit of discontent, let us consider
how little we deserve. To die for one's country, is glorious. How can we
become wise? To seek God is wisdom. What is true greatness? Active
benevolence. A good man is a great man.</p>

<div class="smalltext"><p>NOTE 1. <i>Man</i>, following <i>great</i>, and <i>what</i>, in the last two
examples, are nom. after <i>is</i>: RULE 21. <i>To seek God</i>, and <i>to die
for one's country</i>, are members of sentences, each put as the nom.
case to <i>is</i> respectively: RULE 24. The verb <i>to correct</i> is the
infinitive mood absolute: NOTE under RULE 23. <i>May be allotted</i> is a
passive verb, agreeing with <i>which</i>, the relative part of <i>whatever</i>.
<i>That</i>, the first part of whatever, is an adj. pronoun, agreeing with
<i>task</i>; and <i>task</i> is governed by <i>study.</i> <i>Hear</i>, following <i>let</i>,
and <i>repeat</i>, following <i>hear</i>, are in the infinitive mood without
the sign <i>to</i>, according to RULE 25. <i>To recite</i> is governed by
<i>prepare</i>: RULE 23. <i>Is told</i>, is a passive verb, agreeing with
<i>which</i>, the relative part of <i>whatever</i>; and <i>you</i>, following, is
governed by <i>to</i> understood: NOTE 1, under RULE 32.</p>

<p>2. In parsing a pronoun, if the noun for which it stands is not
expressed, you must say it represents some person or thing
understood.</p></div>

Verbs, you will do well to read again what is said respecting them in
Lecture XI. page 140. The short account there given, and their
application in conjugating verbs, have already made them quite familiar
to you; and you have undoubtedly observed, that, without their help, we
cannot conjugate any verb in any of the tenses, except the present and
imperfect of the indicative and subjunctive moods, and the present of
the imperative and infinitive. In the formation of all the other tenses,
they are brought into requisition.</p>

<p>Most of the <a name="auxiliary_verbs_ii"></a>auxiliary verbs are defective in conjugation; that is, they
are used only in some of the moods and tenses; and when unconnected with
principal verbs, they are conjugated in the following manner:</p>

<p><i>Do, be, have</i>, and <i>will</i>, are sometimes used as principal verbs; and
when employed as such, <i>do, be</i>, and <i>have</i>, may be conjugated, by the
help of other auxiliaries, through all the moods and tenses.</p>

<p>DO. The different tenses of <i>do</i>, in the several moods, are thus formed:
Indicative mood, pres. tense, first pers. sing. I do; imperfect tense, I
did; perf. I have done; pluperfect, I had done; first future, I shall or
will do; sec. fut. I shall have done. Subjunctive mood, pres. tense, If
I do; imperf. if I did; and so on. Imperative mood, do thou. Potential,
pres. I may, can, or must do, &amp;c. Infinitive, present, to do; perf. to
have done. Participles, pres. doing; perf. done; compound, having done.</p>

<a name="Have_ii"></a>
<p>HAVE. <i>Have</i> is in great demand. No verb can be conjugated through all
the moods and tenses without it. <i>Have</i>, when used as a principal verb,
is doubled in some of the past tenses, and becomes an auxiliary to
itself; thus, Indic. mood, pres. tense, first pers. sing. I have;
imperf. tense, I had; perf. I have had; pluperf. I had had; first fut. I
shall or will have; sec. fut. I shall have had. Subjunctive, present, if
I have; imperf. if I had; perf. if I have had; pluperf. if I had had;
first fut. if I shall or will have; sec. fut. if I shall have had.
Imper. mood, have thou. Potential, present, I may, can, or must have;
imperf. I might, could, would, or should have; perf. I may, can, or must
have had; pluperf. I might, could, would, or should have had.
Infinitive, present, to have; perf. to have had. Participles, pres.
having; perf. had; compound, having had.</p>

<p>BE. In the next place I will present to you the conjugation of the
irregular, neuter verb, <i>Be</i>, which is an auxiliary whenever it is
placed before the perfect participle of another verb, but in every other
situation, it is a <i>principal</i> verb.</p>

<p>The neuter verb to <i>be</i>, and all passive verbs, have two forms in the
imperfect tense of this mood, as well as in the present; therefore, the
following rule may serve to direct you in the proper use of each form.
When the sentence implies doubt, supposition, &amp;c. and the neuter verb
<i>be</i>, or the passive verb, is used with a reference to present or future
time, and is either followed or preceded by another verb in the
imperfect of the potential mood, the <i>conjunctive</i> form of the imperfect
tense must be employed; as, &quot;<i>If</i> he <i>were</i> here, we <i>should</i> rejoice
together;&quot; &quot;She <i>might</i> go, <i>were</i> she so disposed.&quot; But when there is
no reference to present or future time, and the verb is neither followed
nor preceded by another in the potential imperfect, the <i>indicative</i>
form of the imperfect tense must be used; as, &quot;<i>If</i> he <i>was</i> ill, he did
not make it known;&quot; &quot;<i>Whether</i> he <i>was</i> absent or present, is a matter
of no consequence.&quot; The general rule for using the conjunctive form of
the verb, is presented on page 145. See, also, page 135.</p>


<div class="smalltext"><p>The perfect, pluperfect, and first future tenses of the subjunctive
mood, are conjugated in a manner similar to the correspondent tenses of

<p>This verb to be, though very irregular in its conjugation, is by far the
most important verb in our language, for it is more frequently used than
any other; many rules of syntax depend on constructions associated with
it, and, without its aid, no passive verb can be conjugated. You ought,
therefore, to make yourself perfectly familiar with all its changes,
before you proceed any farther.</p>

<h3>II. PASSIVE VERBS.</h3>

<p>The <i>cases of nouns</i> are a fruitful theme for investigation and
discussion. In the progress of these lectures, this subject has
frequently engaged our attention; and, now, in introducing to your
notice the passive verb, it will, perhaps, be found both interesting and
profitable to present one more view of the nominative case.</p>

<p>Every sentence, you recollect, must have one <i>finite</i> verb, or more than
one, and one <i>nominative</i>, either expressed or implied, for, without
them, no sentence can exist.</p>

<a name='nominative_ii'></a>
<p>The <i>nominative</i> is the <i>actor</i> or <i>subject</i> concerning which the verb
makes an affirmation. There are three kinds of nominatives, <i>active,
passive</i>, and <i>neuter</i>.</p>

<p>The nominative to an <i>active</i> verb, is <i>active</i>, because it <i>produces</i>
an action, and the nominative to a <i>passive</i> verb, is <i>passive</i>, because
it <i>receives</i> or <i>endures</i> the action expressed by the verb; for,</p>

<div class="bigtext"><p>A <a name="Passive_Verb"></a>Passive Verb denotes action <i>received</i> or <i>endured</i> by the person or
thing which is the nominative; as, &quot;The <i>boy is beaten</i> by his father.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>You perceive, that the nominative <i>boy</i>, in this example, is not
represented as the <i>actor</i>, but as the <i>object</i> of the action expressed
by the verb <i>is beaten</i>; that is, the boy <i>receives</i> or <i>endures</i> the
action performed by his father; therefore <i>boy</i> is a <i>passive</i>
nominative. And you observe, too, that the verb <i>is beaten</i>, denotes the
<i>action</i> received or endured by the nominative; therefore <i>is beaten</i> is
a <i>passive</i> verb.</p>

<p>If I say, John <i>kicked</i> the horse, John is an active nominative, because
he performed or produced the action; but if I say, John <i>was kicked</i> by
the horse, John is a passive nominative, because he received or endured
the action.</p>

<p>The nominative to a <i>neuter</i> verb, is <i>neuter</i>, because it does not
produce an action nor receive one; as, John <i>sits</i> in the chair. John is
here connected with the neuter verb <i>sits</i>, which expresses simply the
state of being of its nominative, therefore <i>John</i> is a neuter
nominative.</p>

<a name="active_passive_and_neuter_nominatives"></a>
<p>I will now illustrate the active, passive, and neuter nominatives by a
few examples.</p>

<p>I. Of ACTIVE NOMINATIVES; as, &quot;The <i>boy</i> beats the dog; The <i>lady</i>
sings; The <i>ball</i> rolls; The <i>man</i> walks.&quot;</p>

<p>II. Of PASSIVE NOMINATIVES; as, &quot;The <i>boy</i> is beaten; The <i>lady</i> is
loved; The <i>ball</i> is rolled; The <i>man</i> was killed.&quot;</p>

<p>III. Of NEUTER NOMINATIVES; as, &quot;The <i>boy</i> remains idle; The <i>lady</i> is
beautiful; The <i>ball</i> lies on the ground; The <i>man</i> lives in town.&quot;
You may now proceed to the conjugation of passive verbs.</p>

<div class="bigtext"><p>Passive Verbs are called <i>regular</i> when they end in <i>ed</i>; as, was
<i>loved</i>; was <i>conquered</i>.</p>

<p>All Passive Verbs <i>are formed</i> by adding the <i>perfect participle</i> of an
active-transitive verb, to the neuter verb <i>to be</i>.</p></div>

<p>If you place a perfect participle of an active-transitive verb after
this neuter verb <i>be</i>, in any mood or tense, you will have a <i>passive</i>
verb in the same mood and tense that the verb <i>be</i> would be in if the
participle were not used; as, I am <i>slighted</i>; I was <i>slighted</i>; he will
be <i>slighted</i>; If I be <i>slighted</i>; I may, can, <i>or</i> must be <i>slighted</i>,
&amp;c. Hence you perceive, that when you shall have learned the conjugation
of the verb <i>be</i>, you will be able to conjugate any passive verb in the
English language.</p>

<p>The regular passive verb to <i>be loved</i>, which is formed by adding the
perfect participle <i>loved</i> to the neuter verb to <i>be</i>, is conjugated in
the following manner:</p>

The birds <i>are flown</i>; The boy <i>is grown</i>; My friend <i>is arrived</i>.&quot;
The following mode of construction, is, in general, to be preferred;
&quot;He <i>has</i> gone; The birds <i>have</i> flown; The boy <i>has</i> grown; My
Friend <i>has</i> arrived.&quot;</p>

<p>2. Active and neuter verbs may be conjugated by adding their present
participle to the auxiliary verb <i>to be</i>, through all its
variations; as, instead of, I teach, thou teachest, he teaches, &amp;c.,
we may say, I am teaching, thou art teaching, he is teaching, &amp;c.;
and, instead of, I taught, &amp;c.; I was teaching, &amp;c. This mode of
conjugation expresses the continuation of an action or state of
being; and has, on some occasions, a peculiar propriety, and
contributes to the harmony and precision of language. When the
present participle of an active verb is joined with the neuter verb
to be, the two words united, are, by some grammarians, denominated
an active verb, either transitive or intransitive, as the case may
be; as, &quot;I am writing a letter; He is walking:&quot; and when the present
participle of a neuter verb is thus employed, they term the
combination a neuter verb; as, &quot;I am sitting; He is standing.&quot;
Others, in constructions like these, parse each word separately.
Either mode may be adopted.</p></div>

<div class="smalltext"><p>NOTE 1. <i>Learn</i>, in the first of the preceding examples, is a
transitive verb, because the action passes over from the nom. <i>you</i>
understood, to <i>the rest of the sentence</i> for its object: RULE 24.
In the next example, <i>that my indiscretions should reach my</i>
<i>posterity</i>, is a part of a sentence put as the nominative to the
verb <i>wounds</i>, according to the same Rule.</p>

<p>2. The noun <i>sacrifice</i>, in the third example, is nom. after the
active-intransitive verb <i>fell</i>: RULE 22. The noun <i>proprietors</i>, in
the next sentence, is in the objective case, and put by apposition
with <i>senate</i> and <i>people</i>: RULE 7, or governed by <i>consider</i>,
understood, according to RULE 35.</p>

<p>3. In the fifth example, <i>what</i>, following <i>proved</i>, is a compound
relative. <i>Thing</i>, the antecedent part, is in the nom. case after
<i>to be</i>, understood, and put by apposition with <i>he</i>, according to
RULE 21, and NOTE. <i>Which</i>, the relative part, is in the obj. case
after <i>to be</i> expressed, and put by apposition with <i>him</i>, according
to the same RULE. <i>Man</i> is in the obj. case, put by apposition with

rendered thus: He plainly appears to have proved <i>to be that base
character which</i> the prophet foresaw him to be, viz. a <i>man</i> of
violence, cruelty, and blood. The antecedent part of the first
<i>what</i>, in the next sentence, is governed by <i>hides</i>; and <i>which</i>,
the relative part, is governed by <i>know</i> understood. The antecedent
part of the second <i>what</i>, is governed by <i>hides</i> understood, and
the relative part is governed by <i>know</i> expressed.</p>

redundant; yet the construction is sometimes admissible, for the
expression is more forcible than it would be to say, &quot;Let him hear

<li>&quot;His son is eight <i>years</i> old.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;My knife is worth a <i>shilling</i>.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;The load weighs a <i>tun</i>.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;The spar measures ninety <i>feet</i>.&quot;</li></ol>


<div class="smalltext"><p>REMARKS.&mdash;<i>Anomaly</i> is derived from the Greek, <i>a</i>, without, and
<i>omales</i>, similar; that is, <i>without similarity</i>. Some give its
derivation thus; <i>anomaly</i>, from the Latin, <i>ab</i>, from, or out of, and
<i>norma</i>, a rule, or law, means an <i>outlaw</i>; a mode of expression that
departs from the rules, laws, or <i>general</i> usages of the language; a
construction in language peculiar to itself. Thus, it is a general rule
of the language, that adjectives of one syllable are compared by adding
<i>r</i>, or <i>er</i>, and <i>st</i>, or <i>est</i>, to the positive degree; but good,
<i>better, best</i>; bad, <i>worse, worst</i>, are not compared according to the
general rule. They are, therefore, anomalies. The plural number of nouns
is generally formed by adding s to the singular: man, <i>men</i>; woman,
<i>women</i>; child, <i>children</i>; penny, <i>pence</i>, are anomalies. The use of
<i>news, means, alms</i> and <i>amends</i>, in the singular, constitutes
anomalies. Anomalous constructions are correct according to custom; but,
as they are departures from general rules, by them they cannot be
analyzed.</p>

<p>An <i>idiom</i>, Latin <i>idioma</i>, a construction peculiar to a language, may
be an anomaly, or it may not. An idiomatical expression which is not an
anomaly, can be analyzed.</p>

<p><i>Feet</i> and <i>years</i>, in the 1st and 2d examples, are not in the
nominative after <i>is</i>, according to Rule 21, because they are not in
apposition with the respective nouns that precede the verb; but the
constructions are anomalous; and, therefore, no rule can be applied to
analyze them. The same ideas, however; can be conveyed by a legitimate
construction which can be analyzed; thus, &quot;The <i>height</i> of the wall is
three <i>feet</i>;&quot; &quot;The <i>age</i> of my son is eight <i>years</i>.&quot;</p>

<a name="worth"></a>
<p>An anomaly, when ascertained to be such, is easily disposed of; but
sometimes it is very difficult to decide whether a construction is
anomalous or not. The 3d, 4th, and 5th examples, are generally
considered anomalies; but if we supply, as we are, perhaps, warranted in
doing, the associated words which modern refinement has dropped, they
will cease to be anomalies; thus, &quot;My knife is <i>of the</i> worth <i>of</i> a
shilling;&quot; &quot;&mdash;<i>of the</i> worth <i>of</i> him,&quot; &amp;c. &quot;He has been there <i>for</i>
three times;&quot; as we say, &quot;I was unwell <i>for</i> three days, after I
arrived;&quot; or, &quot;I was unwell three days.&quot; Thus it appears, that by
tracing back, <i>for</i> a few centuries, what the merely modern English
scholar supposes to be an anomaly, an ellipsis will frequently be
discovered, which, when supplied, destroys the anomaly.</p>

<p>On extreme points, and peculiar and varying constructions in a living
language, the most able philologists can never be agreed; because many
usages will always be unsettled and fluctuating, and will, consequently,
be disposed of according to the caprice of the grammarian. By some, a
sentence may be treated as an anomaly; by others who contend for, and
supply, an ellipsis, the same sentence may be analyzed according to the
ellipsis supplied; whilst others, who deny both the elliptical and
anomalous character of the sentence, construct a rule by which to
analyze it, which rule has for its foundation the principle contained in
that sentence only. This last mode of procedure, inasmuch as it requires
us to make a rule for every peculiar construction in the language,
appears to me to be the most exceptionable of the three. It appears to
be multiplying rules beyond the bounds of utility.</p>

<p>The verbs, <i>cost, weighs</i>, and <i>measures</i>, in the 6th, 7th, and 8th
examples, may be considered as transitive. See remarks on <i>resemble,
have, own</i>, &amp;c., page 56.</p></div>

<a name="nominative_case_independent_iii"></a>
<div class="smalltext"><p>The verb <i>let</i>, in the idiomatic examples under number 1, has no
nominative specified, and is left applicable to a nominative of the
first, second, or third person, and of either number. Every action
necessarily depends on an agent or moving cause; and hence it follows,
that the verb, in such constructions, has a nominative understood; but
as that nominative is not particularly <i>pointed out</i>, the constructions
may be considered anomalous.</p>

<p>Instead of saying, &quot;<i>Let</i> it [<i>to</i>] be enacted;&quot; or, &quot;It <i>is</i> or <i>shall</i>
be enacted;&quot; &quot;<i>Let</i> him [<i>to</i>] be blessed;&quot; or, &quot;He <i>shall</i> be blessed;&quot;
&quot;<i>Let us</i> turn to survey,&quot; &amp;c.; the verbs, <i>be enacted, be blessed,
turn</i>, &amp;c. according to an idiom of our language, or the poet's license,
are used in the <i>imperative</i>, agreeing with a nominative of the first or
third person.</p>

<p>The phrases, <i>methinks</i> and <i>methought</i>, are anomalies, in which the
objective pronoun <i>me</i>, in the <i>first</i> person, is used in place of a
nominative, and takes a verb after it in the <i>third</i> person. <i>Him</i> was
anciently used in the same manner; as, &quot;<i>him thute</i>, him thought.&quot; There
was a period when these constructions were not anomalies in our
language. Formerly, what we call the <i>objective</i> cases of our pronouns,
were employed in the same manner as our present <i>nominatives</i> are. <i>Ago</i>
is a contraction of <i>agone</i>, the past part. of to <i>go</i>. Before this
participle was contracted to an adverb, the noun <i>years</i> preceding it,
was in the nominative case absolute; but now the construction amounts to
an anomaly. The expressions, &quot;generally speaking,&quot; and &quot;considering
their means,&quot; under number 4, are idiomatical and anomalous, the
subjects to the participles not being specified.</p>

<p>According to the genius of the English language, transitive verbs and
prepositions require the <i>objective</i> case of a noun or pronoun after
them; and this requisition is all that is meant by government, when we
say, that these parts of speech govern the objective case. See pages 52,
57, and 94. The same principle applies to the interjection.
Interjections require the <i>objective</i> case of a pronoun of the first
person after them; but the <i>nominative</i> of a noun or pronoun of the
second or third person; as, &quot;Ah <i>me!</i> Oh <i>thou!</i> O my <i>country!</i>&quot; To
say, then, that interjections <i>require</i> particular cases after them, is
synonymous with saying, that they <i>govern</i> those cases; and this office
of the interjection is in perfect accordance with that which it performs
in the Latin and many other languages. In the examples under number 5,
the first <i>me</i> is in the objective after &quot;ah,&quot; and the second <i>me</i>,
after <i>ah</i> understood; thus, &quot;Ah miserable me!&quot; according to NOTE 2,
under Rule 5.&mdash;<i>Happiness</i>, under number 6, is nom. independent; Rule 5,
or in the nom. after <i>O</i>, according to this Note. The principle
contained in the note, proves that every noun of the second person is in
the <i>nominative</i> case; for, as the pronoun of the second person, in such
a situation, is always nominative, which is shown by its <i>form</i>, it
logically follows that the noun, under such circumstances, although it
has <i>no form</i> to show its case, must necessarily be in the same case as
the pronoun. &quot;Good, pleasure, ease, content, <i>that</i>,&quot; the antecedent
part of &quot;whatever,&quot; and <i>which</i>, the relative part, are nom. after <i>art</i>
understood; Rule 21, and <i>name</i> is nom. to <i>be</i> understood.</p>

<p>The second line may be rendered thus; Whether thou art good, or whether
thou art pleasure, &amp;c. or <i>be</i> thy <i>name</i> that [thing] which [ever
thing] it may be: putting <i>be</i> in the imperative, agreeing with <i>name</i>
in the third person. <i>Something</i> is nominative after <i>art</i> understood.</p></div>

<a name='as_iii'></a>
<div class="smalltext"><p>REMARKS.&mdash;According to the principle of analysis assumed by many of our
most critical philologists, <i>but</i> is <i>always</i> a disjunctive conjunction;
and agreeably to the same authorities, to construe it, in any case, as a
preposition, would lead to error. See false Syntax under Rule 35. They
maintain, that its legitimate and undeviating office is, to join on a
member of a sentence which <i>expresses opposition of meaning</i>, and
thereby forms an exception to, or takes from the universality of, the
proposition contained in the preceding member of the sentence. That it
sustains its true character as a conjunction in all the examples under
number 1, will be shown by the following resolution of them.&mdash;&quot;All were
well but the <i>stranger [was not well</i>.&quot;] &quot;I saw nobody but [<i>I saw</i>] the
<i>stranger</i>.&quot; &quot;None deserve the fair but the <i>brave</i> [<i>deserve the
fair</i>.&quot;] &quot;They postpone the thing which [<i>they ought to do, and do not]
but</i> which [<i>thing</i>] they cannot avoid purposing to do.&quot; &quot;This life, at
best, [<i>is not a reality,] but</i> it is a dream. It [<i>affords not
unbounded fruition] but</i> it affords a scanty measure of enjoyment.&quot; &quot;If
he <i>touch</i> the hills, <i>but exert no greater power upon them</i>, they will
smoke;&quot;&mdash;&quot;If <i>he exert no greater power upon the hills, but [be-out this
fact</i>] if he touch them, they will smoke.&quot; &quot;Man <i>is not a stable being,
but</i> he is a reed, floating on the current of time.&quot; This method of
analyzing sentences, however, if I mistake not, is too much on the plan
of our pretended philosophical writers, who, in their rage for ancient
constructions and combinations, often overlook the modern associated
meaning and application of this word. It appears to me to be more
consistent with the <i>modern</i> use of the word, to consider it an <i>adverb</i>
in constructions like the following: &quot;If he <i>but (only, merely)</i> touch
the hills they will smoke.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Except</i> and <i>near</i>, in examples like the following, are generally
construed as prepositions: &quot;All went <i>except him</i>;&quot; &quot;She stands <i>near
them</i>.&quot; But many contend, that when we employ <i>but</i> instead of <i>except</i>,
in such constructions, a <i>nominative</i> should follow: &quot;All went <i>but he
[did not go</i>.&quot;] On this point and many others, <i>custom</i> is <i>variable</i>;
but the period will doubtless arrive, when <i>but, worth</i>, and <i>like</i>,
will be considered prepositions, and, in constructions like the
foregoing, invariably be followed by an objective case. This will not be
the case, however, until the practice of supplying an ellipsis after
these words is entirely dropped.</p>

<p><i>Poverty</i>, under number 2, is governed by the preposition
<i>notwithstanding</i>, Rule 31. The adjectives <i>wide, soft, white</i>, and
<i>deep</i>, under number 3, not only express the quality of nouns, but also
qualify verbs: Note 4, under Rule 18.&mdash;<i>What</i>, in the phrases &quot;what
though&quot; and &quot;what if,&quot; is an interrogative in the objective case, and
governed by the verb <i>matters</i> understood, or by some other verb; thus,
&quot;What matters it&mdash;what dost thou fear, though thou see the swelling
surge?&quot; &quot;What would you think, if the foot, which is ordained to tread
the dust, aspired to be the head?&quot;</p></div>

<p>In the following examples, the same word is used as several parts of
speech. But by exercising judgment sufficient to comprehend the meaning,
and by supplying what is understood, you will be able to analyze them
correctly.</p>

<p>I will now present to you a few examples in poetry. Parsing in poetry,
as it brings into requisition a higher degree of mental exertion than
parsing in prose, will be found a more delightful and profitable
exercise. In this kind of analysis, in order to come at the meaning of
the author, you will find it necessary to <i>transpose</i> his language, and
supply what is understood; and then you will have the literal meaning in
prose.</p>

are in the infinitive mood, gov. by <i>than</i>, according to a NOTE
under Rule 23. <i>Faint</i> and <i>from</i>, in the 5th example, are adverbs.
<i>An adverb, in poetry, is often written in the form of an adjective.</i>

<p>For your future exercises in parsing, you may select pieces from the
English Reader, or any other grammatical work. I have already hinted,
that parsing in poetry, as it brings more immediately into requisition
the reasoning faculties, than parsing in prose, will necessarily tend
more rapidly to facilitate your progress: therefore it is advisable that
your future exercises in this way, be chiefly confined to the analysis
of poetry. Previous to your attempting to parse a piece of poetry, you
ought always to transpose it, in a manner similar to the examples just
presented; and then it can be as easily analyzed as prose.</p>

<p>Before you proceed to correct the following exercises in false syntax,
you may turn back and read over the whole thirteen lectures, unless you
have the subject-matter already stored in your mind.</p>

<br />


<h3>OF DERIVATION.</h3>

<p>At the commencement of Lecture II., I informed you that Etymology
treats, 3dly, of derivation. This branch of Etymology, important as it
is, cannot be very extensively treated in an elementary work on grammar.
In the course of the preceding lectures, it has been frequently
agitated; and now I shall offer a few more remarks, which will doubtless
be useful in illustrating some of the various methods in which one word
is derived from another. Before you proceed, however, please to turn
back and read again what is advanced on this subject on page 27, and in
the PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES.</p>

<ol><li>Nouns are derived from verbs.</li>

<li>Verbs are derived from nouns, adjectives, and sometimes from adverbs.</li>

<li>Adjectives are derived from nouns.</li>

<li>Nouns are derived from adjectives.</li>

<li>Adverbs are derived from adjectives.</li></ol>


<p>1. Nouns are derived from verbs; as, from &quot;to love,&quot; comes &quot;lover;&quot; from
&quot;to visit, visiter;&quot; from &quot;to survive, surviver,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the following instances, and in many others, it is difficult to
determine whether the verb was deduced from the noun, or the noun from
the verb, <i>viz</i>. &quot;Love, to love; hate, to hate; fear, to fear; sleep, to
sleep; walk, to walk; ride, to ride; act, to act,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. Verbs are derived from nouns, adjectives, and sometimes from adverbs;
as, from the noun <i>salt</i>, comes &quot;to salt;&quot; from the adjective <i>warm</i>,
&quot;to warm;&quot; and from the adverb <i>forward</i>, &quot;to forward.&quot; Sometimes they
are formed by lengthening the vowel, or softening the consonant; as,
from &quot;grass, to graze;&quot; sometimes by adding <i>en</i>; as, from &quot;length, to
lengthen;&quot; especially to adjectives; as, from &quot;short, to shorten;
bright, to brighten.&quot;</p>

<p>3. Adjectives are derived from nouns in the following manner: adjectives
denoting plenty are derived from nouns by adding <i>y</i>; as, from &quot;Health,
healthy; wealth, wealthy; might, mighty,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Adjectives denoting the matter out of which any thing is made, are
derived from nouns by adding <i>en</i>; as, from &quot;Oak, oaken; wood, wooden;
wool, woollen,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Adjectives denoting abundance are derived from nouns by adding <i>ful</i>;
as, from &quot;Joy, joyful; sin, sinful; fruit, fruitful,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Adjectives denoting plenty, but with some kind of diminution, are
derived from nouns by adding <i>some</i>; as, from &quot;Light, lightsome;
trouble, troublesome; toil, toilsome,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Adjectives denoting want are derived from nouns by adding <i>less</i>; as,
from &quot;Worth, worthless;&quot; from &quot;care, careless; joy, joyless,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Adjectives denoting likeness are derived from nouns by adding <i>ly</i>; as,
from &quot;Man, manly; earth, earthly; court, courtly,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some adjectives are derived from other adjectives, or from nouns by
adding <i>ish</i> to them; which termination when added to adjectives,
imports diminution, or lessening the quality; as, &quot;White, whitish;&quot; i.e.
somewhat white. When added to nouns, it signifies similitude or tendency
to a character; as, &quot;Child, childish; thief, thievish.&quot;</p>

<p>Some adjectives are formed from nouns or verbs by adding the termination
<i>able</i>; and those adjectives signify capacity; as, &quot;Answer, answerable;
to change, changeable.&quot;</p>

<p>4. Nouns are derived from adjectives, sometimes by adding the
termination <i>ness</i>; as, &quot;White, whiteness; swift, swiftness;&quot; sometimes
by adding <i>th</i> or <i>t</i>, and making a small change in some of the letters;
as, &quot;Long, length; high, height.&quot;</p>

<p>5. Adverbs of quality are derived from adjectives, by adding <i>ly</i>, or
changing <i>le</i> into <i>ly</i>; and denote the same quality as the adjectives
from which they are derived; as, from &quot;base,&quot; comes &quot;basely;&quot; from
&quot;slow, slowly;&quot; from &quot;able, ably.&quot;</p>

<p>There are so many other ways of deriving words from one another, that it
would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to enumerate them. The
primitive words of every language are very few; the derivatives form
much the greater number. A few more instances only can be given here.</p>

<p>Some nouns are derived from other nouns, by adding the terminations
<i>hood</i> or <i>head, ship, ery, wick, rick, dom, ian, ment</i>, and <i>age</i>.</p>

<p>Nouns ending in <i>hood</i> or <i>head</i>, are such as signify character or
qualities; as, &quot;Manhood, knighthood, falsehood,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Nouns ending in <i>ship</i>, are those that signify office, employment,
state, or condition; as, &quot;Lordship, stewardship, partnership,&quot; &amp;c. Some
nouns in <i>ship</i> are derived from adjectives; as, &quot;Hard, hardship,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Nouns which end in <i>ery</i>, signify action or habit; as, &quot;Slavery,
foolery, prudery,&quot; &amp;c. Some nouns of this sort come from adjectives; as,
&quot;Brave, bravery,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Nouns ending in <i>wick, rick</i>, and <i>dom</i>, denote dominion, jurisdiction,
or condition; as, &quot;Bailiwick, bishopric, kingdom, dukedom, freedom,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Nouns which end in <i>ian</i>, are those that signify profession; as,
&quot;Physician, musician,&quot; &amp;c. Those that end in <i>ment</i> and <i>age</i>, come
generally from the French, and commonly signify the act or habit; as,
&quot;Commandment,&quot; &quot;usage.&quot;</p>

<p>Some nouns ending in <i>ard</i>, are derived from verbs or adjectives, and
denote character or habit; as, &quot;Drunk, drunkard; dote, dotard.&quot;</p>

<p>Some nouns have the form of diminutives; but these are not many. They
are formed by adding the terminations <i>kin, ling, ing, ock, el</i>, and the
like; as, &quot;Lamb, lambkin; goose, gosling; duck, duckling; hill, hillock;
cock, cockerel,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<h4>OF PREPOSITIONS USED AS PREFIXES.</h4>

<h3><a name="RULES_OF_SYNTAX"></a>RULES OF SYNTAX,</h3>

<h4>WITH ADDITIONAL EXERCISES IN FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>


<div class='bigtext'><p>The third part of Grammar is SYNTAX, which treats of the agreement and
government of words and of their proper arrangement in a sentence.</p>

<p>SYNTAX consists of two parts, <i>Concord</i> and <i>Government</i>.</p>

<p>CONCORD is the agreement which one word has with another, in gender,
person, number, or case.</p></div>

<p>For the illustration of agreement and government, see pages 52, and 53.</p>

<p>For the definition of a sentence, and the transposition of its words and
members, see pages 119, 124, 128, and 167.</p>

<div class='bigtext'><p>The principal parts of a simple sentence are the <i>nominative</i> or
subject, the <i>verb</i> or attribute, or word that makes the affirmation,
and the <i>object</i>, or thing affected by the action of the verb; as, &quot;A
wise <i>man governs</i> his <i>passions</i>.&quot; In this sentence, <i>man</i> is the
subject; <i>governs</i>, the attribute; and <i>passions</i> the object.</p>

<p>A PHRASE is two or more words rightly put together, making sometimes a
part of a sentence, and sometimes a whole sentence.</p>

<p>ELLIPSIS is the omission of some word or words, in order to avoid
disagreeable and unnecessary repetitions, and to express our ideas
concisely, and with strength and elegance.</p></div>

<p>In this recapitulation of the rules, Syntax is presented in a condensed
form, many of the essential NOTES being omitted. This is a necessary
consequence of my general plan, in which Etymology and Syntax, you know
are blended. Hence, to acquire a complete knowledge of Syntax from this
work, you must look over the whole.</p>

<p>You may now proceed and parse the following additional exercises in
false Syntax; and, as you analyze, endeavor to correct all the errors
without looking at the Key. If, in correcting these examples, you should
be at a loss in assigning the reasons why the constructions are
erroneous, you can refer to the manner adopted in the foregoing pages.</p>

<h4><b>RULE I.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>The article <i>a</i> or <i>an</i> agrees with nouns in the <i>singular</i> number only,
individually or collectively; as, &quot;<i>A</i> star, <i>an</i> eagle, <i>a</i> score, <i>a</i>
thousand.&quot;</p></div>

<h4><b>RULE II.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>The definite article <i>the</i> belongs to nouns in the <i>singular</i> or
<i>plural</i> number; as, &quot;<i>The</i> star, <i>the</i> stars; <i>the</i> hat, <i>the</i> hats.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. A nice distinction in the meaning is sometimes effected by
the use or omission of the article <i>a</i>. If I say, &quot;He behaved with
<i>a</i> little reverence,&quot; my meaning is positive. But if I say, &quot;He
behaved with little reverence,&quot; my meaning is negative. By the
former, I rather praise a person; by the latter, I dispraise him.
When I say, &quot;There were few men with him,&quot; I speak diminutively, and
mean to represent them as inconsiderable; whereas, when I say,
&quot;There were a few men with him,&quot; I evidently intend to make the most
of them.</p>

<p>2. The indefinite article sometimes has the meaning of <i>every</i> or
<i>each</i>; as, &quot;They cost five shillings <i>a</i> dozen;&quot; that is, '<i>every</i>
dozen.'</p>

<div class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A man he was to all the country dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And passing rich with forty pounds <i>a</i> year!&quot;</span></div>

that is, '<i>every</i> year.'

<p>3. When several adjectives are connected, and express the various
qualities of things individually different, though alike in name,
the article should be repeated; but when the qualities all belong to
the same thing or things, the article should not be repeated. &quot;<i>A</i>
black and <i>a</i> white calf,&quot; signifies, A black <i>calf</i>, and a white
<i>calf</i>; but &quot;<i>A</i> black and white calf,&quot; describes the two colors of
<i>one</i> calf.</p></div>

<h4><b>RULE III.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>The nominative case governs the verb; as, &quot;<i>I</i> learn, <i>thou</i> learnest,
<i>he</i> learns, <i>they</i> learn.&quot;</p></div>

<h4><b>RULE IV.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>The verb must agree with its nominative in number and person; as, &quot;The
bird <i>sings</i>, the birds <i>sing</i>, thou <i>singest</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. Every verb, when it is not in the infinitive mood, must have
a nominative, expressed or implied; as, &quot;Awake, arise;&quot; that is,
Awake <i>ye</i>; arise <i>ye</i>.</p>

2. When a verb comes between two nouns, either of which may be
considered as the subject of the affirmation, it must agree with
that which is more naturally its subject; as, &quot;The wages of sin <i>is</i>
death; His meat <i>was</i> locusts and wild honey;&quot; &quot;His pavilion <i>were</i>
dark <i>waters</i> and thick <i>clouds</i>.&quot;
</div>

<a name="nominative_case_independent_iv"></a>
<h4><b>RULE V.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>When an address is made, the noun or pronoun addressed, is put in the
nominative case <i>independent</i>; as, &quot;<i>Plato</i>, thou reasonest well;&quot; &quot;Do,
<i>Trim</i>, said my uncle Toby.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. A noun is independent, when it has no verb to agree with it.</p>

<p>2. Interjections require the objective case of a pronoun of the
<i>first</i> person after them, but the nominative of a noun or pronoun
of the <i>second</i> or <i>third</i> person; as, &quot;Ah! <i>me</i>; Oh! <i>thou</i>; O!
<i>virtue</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<a name="nominative_case_absolute_ii"></a>
<h4><b>RULE VI.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>A noun or pronoun placed before a participle, and being independent of
the rest of the sentence, is in the nominative case <i>absolute</i>; as,
&quot;<i>Shame being lost</i>; all virtue is lost;&quot; &quot;The <i>sun being risen</i>, we
travelled on.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE. Every nominative case, except the case absolute and
independent, should belong to some verb expressed or understood; as,
&quot;To whom thus <i>Adam</i>;&quot; that is, <i>spoke</i>.
</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 5em;'>Him Destroyed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or won to what may work his utter loss,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All this will follow soon.</span><br /></div>

<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;Two substantives, when they come together, and do not
signify the same thing, the former must be in the genitive case.</p>

<p>Virtue, however it may be neglected for a time, men are so constituted
as ultimately to acknowledge and respect genuine merit.</p>

<a name="apposition_ii"></a>
<h4><b>RULE VII.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Two or more nouns, or nouns and pronouns, signifying the same thing, are
put, by apposition, in the same case; as, &quot;<i>Paul</i>, the <i>apostle;</i>&quot;
&quot;<i>Joram</i>, the <i>king;</i>&quot; &quot;<i>Solomon</i>, the <i>son</i> of David, <i>king</i> of Israel,
wrote many proverbs.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE. A noun is sometimes put in apposition with a sentence; as,
&quot;The sheriff has just seized and sold his valuable library&mdash;<i>(which
was) a misfortune</i> that greatly depressed him.&quot;</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We ought to love God, he who created and sustains all things.</span><br /></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>The pronoun <i>he</i> in this sentence, is improperly used in the nominative
case. It is the object of the action of the transitive verb &quot;love,&quot; and
put by apposition with &quot;God;&quot; therefore it should be the objective
case, <i>him</i>, according to Rule 7. (Repeat the Rule, and correct the
following.)</p></div>

<p>I saw Juliet and her brother, they that you visited.</p>

<p>They slew Varus, he that was mentioned before.</p>

<p>It was John, him who preached repentance.</p>

<p>Adams and Jefferson, them who died on the fourth of July 1826, were
both signers and the firm supporters of the Declaration of
Independence.</p>

<p>Augustus the Roman emperor, him who succeeded Julius Cesar, is
variously described by historians.</p>

<h4><b>RULE VIII.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Two or more nouns, or nouns and pronouns, in the <i>singular</i> number,
connected by copulative conjunctions, must have verbs, nouns, and
pronouns, agreeing with them in the <i>plural</i>; as, &quot;Socrates <i>and</i> Plato
<i>were</i> wise; <i>they</i> were eminent <i>philosophers</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. When <i>each</i> or <i>every</i> relates to two or more nominatives in
the singular, although connected by a copulative, the verb must
agree with each of them in the singular; as, &quot;<i>Every</i> leaf, <i>and
every</i> twig, <i>and every</i> drop of water, <i>teems</i> with life.&quot;</p>

<p>2. When the singular nominative of a complex sentence, has another
noun joined to it with a preposition, it is customary to put the
verb and pronoun agreeing with it in the singular; as, &quot;Prosperity
with humility, <i>renders its</i> possessor truly amiable;&quot; &quot;The General,
also, in conjunction with the officers, <i>has</i> applied for redress.&quot;</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>Coffee and sugar grows in the West Indies: it is exported in large
quantities.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Two singular nouns coupled together, form a plural idea. The verb <i>grow</i>
is improper, because it expresses the action of both its nominatives,
&quot;coffee and sugar,&quot; which two nominatives are connected by the
copulative conjunction, <i>and</i>; therefore the verb should be plural,
<i>grow</i>; and then it would agree with coffee <i>and</i> sugar, according to
Rule 8. (Repeat the Rule.) The pronoun <i>it</i>, as it represents both the
nouns, &quot;coffee and sugar,&quot; ought also to be plural, <i>they</i>, agreeably to
Rule 8. The sentence should be written thus. &quot;Coffee and sugar <i>grow</i> in
the West Indies: <i>they are</i> exported in large quantities.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Time and tide waits for no man.</p>

<p>Patience and diligence, like faith, removes mountains.</p>

<p>Life and health is both uncertain.</p>

<p>Wisdom, virtue, happiness, dwells with the golden mediocrity.</p>

<p>The planetary system, boundless space, and the immense ocean,
affects the mind with sensations of astonishment.</p>

<p>What signifies the counsel and care of preceptors, when you think
you have no need of assistance?</p>

<p>Their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished.</p>

<p>Why is whiteness and coldness in snow?</p>

<p>Obey the commandment of thy father, and the law of thy mother; bind
it continually upon thy heart.</p>

<p>Pride and vanity always render its possessor despicable in the eyes
of the judicious.</p>

<p>There is error and discrepance in the schemes of the orthoepists,
which shows the impossibility of carrying them into effect.</p>

<h4>EXAMPLES FOR THE NOTE.</h4>

<p>Every man, woman, and child, were numbered.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Not proper; for, although <i>and</i> couples things together so as to present
the whole at one view, yet <i>every</i> has a contrary effect: it distributes
them, and brings each separately and singly under consideration. <i>Were</i>
numbered is therefore improper. It should be, &quot;<i>was</i> numbered,&quot; in the
singular, according to the Note. (Repeat it.)</p></div>

<p>When benignity and gentleness reign in our breasts, every person and
every occurrence are beheld in the most favorable light.
</p>
<h4><b>RULE IX.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Two or more nouns, or nouns and pronouns, in the <i>singular</i> number,
connected by disjunctive conjunctions, must have verbs, nouns, and
pronouns, agreeing with them in the <i>singular</i>; as, &quot;Neither John <i>nor</i>
James <i>has</i> learned <i>his</i> lesson.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. When singular pronouns, or a noun and pronoun, of different
persons, are disjunctively connected, the verb must agree, in
person, with that which is placed nearest to it; as, &quot;Thou <i>or</i> I
<i>am</i> in fault; I <i>or</i> thou <i>art</i> to blame; I, <i>or</i> thou, <i>or</i> he,
<i>is</i> the author of it.&quot; But it would be better to say &quot;Either I am
to blame or thou art,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. When a disjunctive occurs between a singular noun or pronoun and
a plural one, the verb must agree with the plural noun or pronoun,
which should generally be placed next to the verb; as, &quot;Neither
poverty <i>nor riches</i> were injurious to him;&quot; &quot;I <i>or</i> they were
offended by it.&quot;</p>

<p>Constructions like these ought generally to be avoided.</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>Ignorance or negligence have caused this mistake.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>The verb, <i>have</i> caused, in this sentence, is improperly used in the
plural, because it expresses the action, not of <i>both</i>, but of either
the one or the other of its nominatives; therefore it should be in the
singular, <i>has</i> caused; and then it would agree with &quot;ignorance <i>or</i>
negligence,&quot; agreeably to Rule 9 (Repeat the Rule.)</p></div>

<p>A circle or a square are the same in idea.</p>

<p>Neither whiteness nor redness are in the porphyry.</p>

<p>Neither of them are remarkable for precision.</p>

<p>Man is not such a machine as a clock or a watch, which move merely
as they are moved.</p>

<p>When sickness, infirmity, or reverse of fortune, affect us, the
sincerity of friendship is proved.</p>

<p>Man's happiness or misery are, in a great measure, put into his own
hands.</p>

<p>Despise no infirmity of mind or body, nor any condition of life, for
they may be thy own lot.</p>

<p>The prince, as well as the people, were blameworthy.</p>

<h4><b>RULE X.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>A collective noun or noun of multitude, conveying <i>unity</i> of idea,
generally has a verb or pronoun agreeing with it in the <i>singular</i>; as,
&quot;The <i>meeting was</i> large, and <i>it</i> held three hours.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'>NOTE. Rules 10, and 11, are limited in their application. See page. 59
</div>
<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>The nation are powerful.</p>

<p>The fleet were seen sailing up the channel.</p>

<p>The church have no power to inflict corporal punishment. The
flock, and not the fleece, are, or ought to be, the objects of the
shepherd's care.</p>

<p>That nation was once powerful; but now they are feeble.</p>

<h4><b>RULE XI.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>A noun of multitude, conveying <i>plurality</i> of idea, must have a verb or
pronoun agreeing with it in the <i>plural</i>; as, &quot;The <i>council were</i>
divided in <i>their</i> sentiments.&quot;</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>My people doth not consider.</p>

<p>The multitude eagerly pursues pleasure as its chief good.</p>

<p>The committee was divided in its sentiments, and it has referred the
business to the general meeting.</p>

<p>The people rejoices in that which should give it sorrow.</p>

<h4><b>RULE XII.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>A noun or pronoun in the possessive case, is governed by the noun it
possesses; as, &quot;<i>Man's</i> happiness;&quot; &quot;<i>Its</i> value is great.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. When the possessor is described by a circumlocution, the
possessive sign should generally be applied to the last term only;
as, &quot;The <i>duke of Bridgewater's</i> canal; The <i>bishop of Landaff's</i>
excellent book; The <i>captain of the guard's</i> house.&quot; This usage,
however, ought generally to be avoided. The words do not literally
convey the ideas intended. What nonsense to say, &quot;This is <i>the</i>
<i>governor of Ohio's</i> house!&quot;</p>

<p>2. When nouns in the possessive case are in apposition, and follow
each other in quick succession, the possessive sign is generally
annexed to the last only; as, &quot;For <i>David</i> my <i>servant's</i> sake;
<i>John</i> the <i>Baptist's</i> head; The canal was built in consequence of
<i>De Witt Clinton</i> the <i>governor's</i> advice.&quot;</p>

<p>But when a pause is proper, and the governing noun not expressed,
the sign should be applied to the first possessive only, and
understood to the rest; as, &quot;I reside at Lord <i>Stormont's</i>, my old
<i>patron</i> and <i>benefactor</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>3. <i>Its</i>, the possessive case of <i>it</i>, is often improperly used for
<i>'tis</i>, or, <i>it is</i>; as, &quot;<i>Its</i> my book: <i>Its</i> his,&quot; &amp;c.; instead
of, <i>&quot;It is</i> my book; or, <i>'Tis</i> my book; <i>It is</i> his; or, <i>'Tis</i>
his.&quot;</p>

<p>4. Participles frequently govern nouns and pronouns in the
possessive case, as, &quot;In case of his <i>majesty's dying</i> without
issue, &amp;c.; Upon <i>God's having ended</i> all his works, &amp;c.; I remember
<i>its being reckoned</i> a great exploit; At <i>my coming</i> in he said,&quot;
&amp;c. But in such instances, the participle with its adjuncts may be
considered a substantive phrase, according to Note 2, Rule 28.</p>

<p>5. Phrases like these, &quot;A work of <i>Washington Irving's</i>; A brother
of <i>Joseph's</i>; A friend of <i>mine</i>; A neighbor of <i>yours</i>,&quot; do not,
as some have supposed, each contain a double possessive, or two
possessive cases, but they may be thus construed; &quot;A work of (<i>out
of</i>, or, <i>among the number of) Washington Irving's works</i>; that is,
One of the works of <i>Washington Irving</i>; One of the brothers <i>of
Joseph</i>; One friend <i>of my friends</i>; One neighbor of <i>your
neighbors</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>Homers works are much admired.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Asa his heart was not perfect with the Lord.</p>

<p>James Hart, his book, bought August the 19, 1829.</p>

<p><i>Note</i> 1. It was the men's, women's, and children's lot to suffer
great calamities.</p>

<p>This is Peter's, John's, and Andrew's occupation.</p>

<p><i>Note</i> 2. This is Campbell's the poet's production.</p>

<p>The silk was purchased at Brown's, the mercer's and haberdasher's.</p>

<p><i>Note</i> 4. Much will depend on the pupil composing frequently.</p>

<p>Much depends on this rule being observed.</p>

<p>The measure failed in consequence of the president neglecting to lay
it before the council.</p>

<h4><b>RULE XIII.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Personal pronouns must agree with the nouns for which they stand, in
<i>gender</i> and <i>number</i>; as, &quot;<i>John</i> writes, and <i>he</i> will soon write
well.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE. You, though frequently employed to represent a singular noun,
is always <i>plural in form</i>; therefore the verb connected with it
should be plural; as, &quot;My friend, you <i>were</i> mistaken.&quot; See pages 99
and 100.</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX</h4>

<p>Every man will be rewarded according to their works.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Incorrect, because the pronoun <i>their</i> does not agree in gender or
number with the noun &quot;man,&quot; for which it stands; consequently Rule 13,
is violated. <i>Their</i> should be <i>his</i>; and then the pronoun would be of
the masculine gender, singular number, agreeing with <i>man</i>, according to
Rule 13. (Repeat the Rule.)</p></div>

<p>An orator's tongue should be agreeable to the ear of their audience.</p>

<p>Rebecca took goodly raiment, and put them on Jacob.</p>

<p>Take handfuls of ashes, and let Moses sprinkle it towards heaven, in
the sight of Pharaoh, and it shall become small dust.</p>

<p>No one should incur censure for being tender of their reputation.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>. Horace, you was blamed; and I think you was worthy of
censure.</p>

<p>Witness, where was you standing during the transaction? How far was
you from the defendant?</p>


<h4><b>RULE XIV.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Relative pronouns agree with their antecedents, in <i>gender</i>, <i>person</i>,
and <i>number</i>; as, &quot;Thou <i>who lovest</i> wisdom;&quot; &quot;I <i>who speak</i> from
experience.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE. When a relative pronoun is preceded by two antecedents of
different persons, the relative and the verb may agree in person
with either, but not without regard to the sense; as, &quot;I am the man
<i>who command</i> you;&quot; or, &quot;I am the man <i>who commands</i> you.&quot; The
meaning of the first of these examples will more obviously appear,
if we render it thus: &quot;I who command you, am the <i>man</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>When the agreement of the relative has been fixed with either of the
preceding antecedents, it must be preserved throughout the sentence;
as, &quot;I am the <i>Lord, that maketh</i> all things; <i>that stretcheth</i>
forth the heavens alone; <i>that spreadeth</i> abroad the earth by
myself,&quot; &amp;c.</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>Thou who has been a witness of the fact, canst state it.</p>

<p>The wheel killed another man, which make the sixth which have lost
their lives by this means.</p>

<p>Thou great First Cause, least understood!</p>

<p>Who all my sense confined.</p>

<p><i>Note, 2d part</i>. Thou art the Lord, who didst choose Abraham, and
brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees.</p>

<h4><b>RULE XV.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>The relative is the nominative case to the verb, when no nominative
comes between it and the verb; as, &quot;The master <i>who</i> taught us, was
eminent.&quot;</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>If he will not hear his best friend, whom shall be sent to admonish
him.</p>

<p>This is the man whom, he informed me, was my benefactor.</p>

<h4><b>RULE XVI.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>When a nominative comes between the relative and the verb, the relative
is governed by the following verb, or by some other word in its own
member of the sentence; as, &quot;He <i>whom</i> I <i>serve</i>, is eternal.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. <i>Who, which, what</i>, the relative <i>that</i>, and their
compounds, <i>whomever, whomsoever</i>, &amp;c., though in the objective
case, are always placed before the verb; as, &quot;He <i>whom</i> ye <i>seek</i>,
has gone hence.&quot;</p>

<p>2. Every relative must have an antecedent to which it relates,
either expressed or implied; as, &quot;<i>Who</i> steals my purse, steals
trash;&quot; that is, <i>he</i> who.</p>

<p>3. The pronouns <i>whichsoever, whatsoever</i>, and the like, are
sometimes elegantly divided by the interposition of the
corresponding nouns; as, &quot;On <i>which</i> side <i>soever</i> the <i>king</i> cast
his eyes,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. The pronoun <i>what</i> is sometimes improperly used instead of the
conjunction <i>that;</i> as, &quot;He would not believe but <i>what</i> I was in
fault.&quot; It should be &quot;but <i>that</i>,&quot; &amp;c.</p></div>

<h4><b>RULE XVII.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>When a relative pronoun is of the interrogative kind, it refers to the
word or phrase containing the answer to the question for its

interrogative; as, &quot;<i>Whose</i> book is that? <i>Joseph's;&quot; &quot;Who</i> gave you
this? <i>John</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE. Whether the interrogative <i>really refers</i> to a subsequent or
not, is doubtful; but it is certain that the subsequent should agree
in case with the interrogative.</p></div>

bookseller, he who lives in Pearl street.</p>

<p>Who walked with you? My brother and him.</p>

<p>Who will accompany me to the country? Her and me.</p>

<h4><b>RULE XVIII.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Adjectives belong to, and qualify nouns, expressed or understood; as,
&quot;He is a <i>good</i>, as well as a <i>wise</i> man.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. Adjectives frequently belong to pronouns; as, &quot;I am
<i>miserable; He</i> is <i>industrious</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>2. Numeral adjectives belong to nouns, which nouns must agree in
number with their adjectives, when of the <i>cardinal</i> kind; as, &quot;Ten
<i>feet</i>; Eighty <i>fathoms</i>.&quot; But some anomalous and figurative
expressions form an exception to this rule; as, &quot;A fleet of <i>forty</i>
<i>sail;&quot; &quot;Two hundred head of cattle</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>3. Adjectives sometimes belong to verbs in the infinitive mood, or
to a part of a sentence; as, &quot;<i>To see</i> is <i>pleasant</i>; To be blind is
<i>unfortunate</i>; To die for our country is <i>glorious</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>4. Adjectives are often used to modify the sense of other
adjectives, or the action of verbs, and to express the quality of
things in connexion with the action by which that quality is
produced; as, &quot;<i>Red hot</i> iron; <i>Pale blue</i> lining; <i>Deep sea-green</i>
sash; The apples boil <i>soft</i>; Open your hand <i>wide</i>; The clay burns
<i>white</i>; The fire burns <i>blue</i>; The eggs boil <i>hard</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>5. When an adjective is preceded by a preposition, and the noun is
understood, the two words may be considered an adverbial phrase; as,
&quot;In general, in particular;&quot; that is, generally, particularly.</p>

<p>6. Adjectives should be placed next to the nouns which they qualify;
as, &quot;A tract of <i>good</i> land.&quot;</p>

<p>7. We should generally avoid comparing such adjectives as do not
literally admit of comparison; such as, <i>more impossible, most</i>
<i>impossible; more unconquerable, more perfect</i>, &amp;c. See REMARKS on
adjectives, page 76.</p>

<p>8. When an adjective or an adverb is used in comparing two objects,
it should be in the comparative degree; but when more than two are
compared, the superlative ought to be employed; as, &quot;Julia is the
<i>taller</i> of the two; Her specimen is the <i>best</i> of the three.&quot;</p>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Adjective pronouns belong to nouns, expressed or understood; as, &quot;<i>Any</i>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. The demonstrative adjective pronouns must agree in number
with their nouns; as, &quot;<i>This</i> book, <i>these</i> books; <i>that</i> sort,
<i>those</i> sorts.&quot;</p>

<p>2. The pronominal adjectives, <i>each, every, either, neither,
another</i>, and <i>one</i>, agree with nouns in the singular number only;
as, &quot;<i>Each</i> man, <i>every</i> person, <i>another</i> lesson;&quot; unless the
plural nouns convey a collective idea: as, &quot;<i>Every</i> six months.&quot;</p>

<p>3. <i>Either</i> is often improperly employed instead of <i>each;</i> as, &quot;The
king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, sat <i>either</i> of
them on his throne.&quot; <i>Each</i> signifies <i>both</i> taken separately;
<i>either</i> implies only <i>the one</i> or <i>the other</i> taken
disjunctively:&mdash;&quot;sat <i>each</i> on <i>his</i> throne.&quot;</p>

</div>
<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>Ye who were dead, hath he quickened.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Ye</i>, in the nominative case, is erroneous, because it is the object of
the action expressed by the transitive verb &quot;hath quickened;&quot; and
therefore it should be <i>you</i>, in the objective case. <i>You</i> would then be
governed by &quot;hath quickened,&quot; agreeably, to Rule 20. <i>Active-transitive
verbs govern the objective case</i>.</p></div>

<h4><b>RULE XXI</b>.</h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>The verb <i>to be</i> may have the same case after it as before it; as, &quot;<i>I</i>
am the <i>man</i>;&quot; &quot;I believe <i>it</i> to have been <i>them;</i>&quot; &quot;<i>He</i> is the
<i>thief</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. When nouns or pronouns next preceding and following the verb
<i>to be</i>, signify the <i>same thing</i>, they are <i>in apposition</i>, and,
therefore, in the <i>same case</i>. Rule 21 is predicated on the
principle contained in Rule 7.</p>

<p>2. The verb <i>to be</i> is often understood; as, &quot;The Lord made <i>me
man</i>; He made <i>him what</i> he was;&quot; that is, &quot;The Lord made me <i>to be</i>
man; He made him <i>to be that which</i> he was.&quot; &quot;They desired me to
call <i>them brethren</i>;&quot; i.e. <i>by the name of</i> brethren. &quot;They named
<i>him John</i>;&quot; i.e. <i>by the name of</i> John; or, by the <i>name</i> John;
putting these two nouns in <i>apposition</i>.</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>I know it to be they.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Improper, because <i>it</i> is in the objective case before the verb &quot;to be,&quot;
and <i>they</i> is in the nominative after; consequently, Rule 21 is
violated. <i>They</i> is in apposition with <i>it</i>, therefore <i>they</i> should be
<i>them</i>, in the objective after to be, according to Rule 21. (Repeat the

<p>If it was not him, who do you imagine it to have been?</p>

<p>He supposed it was me; but you knew that it was him.</p>

<h4><b>RULE XXII.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'>Active-intransitive and passive verbs, the verb <i>to become</i>, and other
neuter verbs, have the same case after them as before them, when both
words refer to, and signify, the same thing; as, &quot;<i>Tom</i> struts a
<i>soldier</i>;&quot; &quot;<i>Will</i> sneaks a <i>scrivener</i>;&quot; &quot;<i>He</i> was called <i>Cesar</i>;&quot;
&quot;The <i>general</i> was saluted <i>emperor</i>;&quot; &quot;<i>They</i> have become <i>fools</i>.&quot;</div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. Active-intransitive verbs sometimes assume a transitive
form, and govern the objective case; as, &quot;<i>To dream</i> a <i>dream; To
run</i> a <i>race; To walk</i> the <i>horse; To dance</i> the <i>child; To fly</i> the
<i>kite</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>2. According to a usage too common in colloquial style, an agent not
literally the correct one, is employed as the nominative to a
passive verb, which causes the verb to be followed by an <i>objective</i>
case without the possibility of supplying before it a preposition:
thus, &quot;<i>Pitticus</i> was offered a large <i>sum</i> by the king;&quot; &quot;<i>She</i> was
promised <i>them</i> (the <i>jewels</i>) by her mother;&quot; &quot;<i>I</i> was asked a
<i>question</i>.&quot; It would be better sense, and more agreeable to the
idiom of our language, to say, &quot;A large <i>sum</i> was offered <i>to
Pitticus</i>;&quot; &quot;<i>They</i> were promised <i>(to) her</i>;&quot; &quot;A <i>question</i> was put
<i>to me</i>.&quot;</p>

<a name="compound_ii"></a>
<p>3. Some passive verbs are formed by using the participles of
compound active verbs. To <i>smile</i>, to <i>wonder</i>, to <i>dream</i>, are
intransitive verbs, for which reason they have no passive voice;
but, to <i>smile on</i>, to <i>wonder at</i>, to <i>dream of</i>, are compound
active-transitive verbs, and, therefore, admit of a passive voice;
as, &quot;He <i>was smiled on</i> by fortune; The accident is not <i>to be
wondered at</i>;&quot;</p></div>

<div class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Than <i>are dreamed of</i> in your philosophy.&quot;</span><br /></div>

<h4><b>RULE XXIII.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>A verb in the infinitive mood may be governed by a verb, noun,
adjective, participle, or pronoun; as, &quot;<i>Cease</i> to do evil;&quot; &quot;We all
have our <i>talent</i> to be improved;&quot; &quot;She is <i>eager</i> to learn;&quot; &quot;They are
<i>preparing</i> to go;&quot; &quot;Let <i>him</i> do it.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>ILLUSTRATION. The supposed principle of <i>government</i> referred to in this
rule, may be thus illustrated. In the sentence, &quot;Cease to do evil,&quot; the
peculiar manner in which <i>cease</i> is introduced, <i>requires</i> or <i>compels</i>
us to put the verb <i>do</i> in the infinitive mood; and, according to the
genius of our language, we cannot express this act of doing, when thus
connected with <i>cease</i>, in any other mood, unless we change the
construction of the sentence. Hence we say, that <i>cease</i> governs the
mood of the verb <i>do</i>. Similar remarks may be applied to the words
<i>talent</i>, <i>eager</i>, <i>preparing</i>, and <i>him</i>, in the respective examples
under the rule.</p>

<p>Many respectable grammarians refer the government of this mood
invariably to the preposition <i>to</i> prefixed, which word they do not, of
course, consider a part of the verb. Others contend, and with some
plausibility, that this mood is not governed by any particular word. If
we reject the idea of government, as applied to the verb in this mood,
the following rule, if substituted for the foregoing, might, perhaps,
answer all practical purposes.</p></div>

<h4><b>RULE.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'>A verb in the infinitive mood, refers to some noun or pronoun, as its
subject or actor.</div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>ILLUSTRATION of the examples under Rule XXIII. &quot;To do&quot; refers to <i>thou</i>
understood for its agent; &quot;to be improved&quot; refers to <i>talent</i>; &quot;to
learn,&quot; to <i>she</i>; &quot;to go,&quot; to <i>they</i>; and &quot;to do,&quot; refers to <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>NOTE 1. The infinitive mood absolute stands independent of the rest
of the sentence; as, &quot;<i>To confess</i> the truth, I was in fault.&quot;</p>

<p>2. The infinitive mood is sometimes governed by conjunctions or
adverbs; as, &quot;An object so high <i>as to be</i> invisible;&quot; &quot;He is wise
<i>enough to deceive</i>;&quot; &quot;The army is <i>about to march</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<h4><b>RULE XXIV.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'>The infinitive mood, or part of a sentence, is frequently put as the
nominative case to a verb, or the object of an active-transitive verb;
as, &quot;<i>To play</i> is pleasant;&quot; &quot;Boys love <i>to play</i>;&quot; &quot;<i>That warm climates
shorten life</i>, is reasonable to suppose;&quot; &quot;He does not consider <i>how
near he approaches to his end</i>.&quot;</div>

<div class='smalltext'>NOTE. <i>To</i>, the sign of the infinitive mood, is sometimes properly
omitted; as, &quot;I heard him <i>say</i> it;&quot; instead of, &quot;to <i>say</i> it.&quot;</div>

<h4><b>RULE XXV.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'>The verbs which follow <i>bid</i>, <i>dare</i>, <i>need</i>, <i>make</i>, <i>see</i>, <i>hear</i>,
<i>feel</i>, <i>help</i>, <i>let</i>, and their participles, are in the infinitive mood
without the sign <i>to</i> prefixed; as, &quot;He bids me <i>come</i>;&quot; &quot;I dare
<i>engage</i>;&quot; &quot;Let me <i>go</i>;&quot; &quot;Help me <i>do it</i>;&quot; i.e. <i>to come</i>, <i>to go</i>,
<i>to do</i> it, &amp;c. &quot;He is <i>hearing</i> me <i>recite</i>.&quot;</div>

one, and to reject the other.</p>

<p>It is better live on a little, than outlive a great deal.</p>

<p>I wish him not wrestle with his happiness.</p>

<h4><b>RULE XXVI.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Participles have the same government as the verbs have from which they
are derived; as, &quot;I saw the tutor <i>instructing</i> his <i>pupils</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE. The present participle with the definite article <i>the</i> before
it, becomes a noun, and must have the preposition <i>of</i> after it.
<i>The</i> and <i>of</i> must both be used, or both be omitted; as, &quot;By <i>the</i>
observing <i>of</i> truth, you will command respect;&quot; or, &quot;By observing
truth,&quot; &amp;c.</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p><i>Note</i>. We cannot be wise and good without the taking pains for it.</p>

<p>The changing times and seasons, the removing and setting up kings,
belong to Providence alone.</p>

<p>These are the rules of grammar, by observing of which you may avoid
mistakes.</p>

<h4><b>RULE XXVII.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'>The present participle refers to some noun or pronoun denoting the
subject or actor; as, &quot;I see a <i>boy running</i>.&quot;</div>

<h4><b>RULE XXVIII.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'>The perfect participle belongs, like an adjective, to some noun or
pronoun, expressed or understood; as, &quot;I saw the boy <i>abused</i>.&quot;</div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. Participles of neuter verbs have the same case after them as
before them; as, &quot;<i>Pontius Pilate</i> being <i>Governor</i> of Judea, and
<i>Herod</i> being <i>Tetrarch</i>,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. A participle with its adjuncts, may sometimes be considered as a
substantive or participial phrase, which phrase may be the subject
of a verb, or the object of a verb or preposition; as, &quot;<i>Taking from</i>
<i>another without his knowledge or assent</i>, is called stealing; He
studied to avoid <i>expressing himself too severely</i>; I cannot fail of
<i>having money</i>, &amp;c.; By <i>promising much and performing but little</i>,
we become despicable.&quot;</p>

<p>3. As the perfect participle and the imperfect tense of irregular
verbs, are sometimes different in their form, care must be taken
that they be not indiscriminately used. It is frequently said, 'He
begun,' for 'he began;' 'He run,' for 'he ran;' 'He come,' for 'he
came;' the participles being here used instead of the imperfect
tense; and much more frequently is the imperfect tense employed
instead of the participle; as, 'I had wrote,' for 'I had written;'
'I was chose,' for 'I was chosen;' 'I have eat,' for 'I have eaten.'
'He would have spoke;'&mdash;<i>spoken</i>. 'He overrun his
guide;'&mdash;<i>overran</i>. 'The sun had rose;'&mdash;<i>risen</i>.</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>I seen him. I have saw many a one.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Seen</i> is improper, the perfect participle being used instead of the
imperfect tense of the verb. It ought to be, &quot;I <i>saw</i> him,&quot; according to
Note 3, <i>Have saw</i> is also erroneous, the imperfect tense being employed
instead of the perfect participle. The perfect tense of a verb is formed
by combining the auxiliary <i>have</i> with its perfect participle: therefore
the sentence should be written thus, &quot;I have <i>seen</i> many a one:&quot; Note 3.</p></div>

<p><i>Note</i> 3. He done me no harm, for I had wrote my letter before he
come home.</p>

<p>Had not that misfortune befel my cousin, he would have went to
Europe long ago.</p>

<p>The French language is spoke in every state in Europe.</p>

<p>He writes as the best authors would have wrote, had they writ on the
same subject.</p>

<h4><b>RULE XXIX.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Adverbs qualify verbs, participles, adjectives, and other adverbs; as,
&quot;A <i>very good</i> pen <i>writes extremely well</i>;&quot; &quot;By <i>living temperately</i>,&quot;
&amp;c.</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. Adverbs are generally set before adjectives or adverbs,
after verbs, or between the auxiliary and the verb; as, &quot;He made a
<i>very sensible</i> discourse, and was <i>attentively</i> heard.&quot;</p>

<p>2. When the qualifying word which follows a verb, expresses
<i>quality</i>, it must be an adjective, but when it expresses <i>manner</i>,
an adverb should be used; as, &quot;She looks <i>cold;</i> She looks <i>coldly</i>
on him; He feels <i>warm;</i> He feels <i>warmly</i> the insult offered to
him.&quot; If the verb <i>to be</i> can be substituted for the one employed,
an adjective should follow, and not an adverb; as, &quot;She looks <i>[is]
cold</i>; The hay smells <i>[is] sweet</i>; The fields look <i>[are] green</i>;
The apples taste <i>[are] sour</i>; The wind blows <i>[is] fresh</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>3. It is not strictly proper to apply the adverbs <i>here, there</i>, and
<i>where</i>, to verbs signifying motion, instead of the adverbs <i>hither,
thither, whither</i>; thus, &quot;He came <i>here [hither]</i> hastily;&quot; &quot;They
rode <i>there [thither]</i> in two hours;&quot; &quot;<i>Where [whither]</i> will he
go?&quot; But in familiar style, these constructions are so far
sanctioned as sometimes to be admissible.</p>

<p>4. The use of <i>where</i>, instead of <i>in which</i>, in constructions like
the following, is hardly admissible: &quot;The immortal sages of '76,
formed a charter, <i>where [in which]</i> their rights are boldly
<i>asserted.&quot;</i></p>

<p>5. As the adverbs <i>hence, thence</i>, and <i>whence</i>, literally supply
the place of a noun and preposition, there appears to be a solecism
in employing a preposition in conjunction with them: &quot;<i>From whence</i>
it follows;&quot; &quot;He came <i>from thence</i> since morning.&quot; Better,
&quot;<i>whence</i> it follows;&quot; &quot;He came <i>thence</i>.&quot; The following phrases are
also exceptionable: &quot;The <i>then</i> ministry;&quot; &quot;The <i>above</i> argument;&quot;
&quot;Ask me <i>never</i> so much dowry;&quot; &quot;Charm he <i>never</i> so wisely.&quot;
Better, &quot;The ministry <i>of that time</i> or <i>period</i>;&quot; &quot;The <i>preceding</i>
argument;&quot; &quot;<i>Ever</i> so much dowry;&quot; &quot;<i>Ever</i> so wisely.&quot;</p></div>

<p>We may happily live, though our possessions are small.</p>

<h4><b>RULE XXX.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Two negatives destroy one another, and are generally equivalent to an
affirmative; as, &quot;Such things are <i>not un</i>common;&quot; i.e. they are common.</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE. When one of the two negatives employed is joined to another
word, it forms a pleasing and delicate variety of expression; as,
&quot;His language, though inelegant, is <i>not un</i>grammatical;&quot; that is,
it is grammatical.</p>

<p>But, as two negatives, by destroying each other, are equivalent to
an affirmative, they should not be used when we wish to convey a
<i>negative</i> meaning. The following sentence is therefore inaccurate:
&quot;I can<i>not</i> by <i>no</i> means allow him what his argument must prove.&quot;
It should be, &quot;I cannot by <i>any</i> means,&quot; &amp;c., or, &quot;I <i>can</i> by <i>no</i>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. The prepositions <i>to</i> and <i>for</i> are often understood,
chiefly before the pronouns; as, &quot;Give [to] <i>me</i> a book; Get [for]
<i>him</i> some paper.&quot;</p>

<p>2. <i>To</i> or <i>unto</i>, is, by some, supposed to be understood after
<i>like</i> and <i>unlike</i>; as, &quot;He is <i>like</i> [unto] his brother; She is
<i>unlike</i> [to] him.&quot; Others consider this mode of expression an idiom
of the language, and maintain that <i>like</i> governs the objective
following it.</p>

<p>3. Nouns signifying extension, duration, quantity, quality, or
value, are used without a governing word; as, &quot;The Ohio is one
thousand <i>miles</i> long; She is ten <i>years</i> old; My hat is worth ten
<i>dollars</i>.&quot; These are sometimes considered anomalies. See page 163.</p></div>


<h4><b>RULE XXXIII.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Conjunctions connect nouns and pronouns in the same case; as, &quot;The
master taught <i>her</i> and <i>me</i> to write;&quot; &quot;<i>He</i> and <i>she</i> are associates.&quot;</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>My brother and him are grammarians.</p>

<p>You and me enjoy great privileges.</p>

<p>Him and I went to the city in company; but John and him returned
without me.</p>

<p>Between you and I there is a great disparity of years.</p>


<h4><b>RULE XXXIV.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>Conjunctions generally connect verbs of like moods and tenses; as, &quot;If
thou sincerely <i>desire, and</i> earnestly <i>pursue</i> virtue, she <i>will</i>
assuredly <i>be found</i> by thee, <i>and prove</i> a rich reward.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. When different moods and tenses are connected by
conjunctions, the nominative must be repeated; as, &quot;He <i>may return</i>,
but <i>he will</i> not <i>tarry</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>2. Conjunctions implying contingency or doubt, require the
subjunctive mood after them; as, &quot;<i>If</i> he <i>study</i>, he will improve.&quot;
See pages 135, 145, and 155.</p>

<p>3. The conjunctions <i>if</i>, <i>though</i>, <i>unless</i>, <i>except</i>, <i>whether</i>,
and <i>lest</i>, generally require the subjunctive mood after them.</p>

<p>4. Conjunctions of a positive and absolute nature, implying no
doubt, require the indicative mood; as, &quot;<i>As</i> virtue <i>advances, so</i>
vice <i>recedes</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>Did he not tell me his fault, and entreated me to forgive him?</p>

<p>Professing regard, and to act differently, discovers a base mind.</p>

<p><i>Note</i> 1. He has gone home, but may return.</p>

<p>The attorney executed the deed, but will write no more.</p>

<p><i>Note</i> 2. I shall walk to-day, unless it rains.</p>

<p>If he acquires riches, they will corrupt his mind.</p>


<h4><b>RULE XXXV.</b></h4>

<div class='bigtext'><p>A noun or pronoun following the conjunction <i>than</i>, <i>as</i>, or <i>but</i>, is
nominative to a verb, or governed by a verb or preposition, expressed or
understood; as, &quot;Thou art wiser <i>than</i> I [<i>am</i>.&quot;] &quot;I saw nobody <i>but</i>
[<i>I saw</i>] him.&quot;</p></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1. The conjunction <i>as</i>, when it is connected with <i>such</i>,
<i>many</i>, or <i>same</i>, is sometimes, though erroneously, called a
<i>relative pronoun</i>; as, &quot;Let <i>such</i> as presume to advise others,&quot;
&amp;c.; that is, Let <i>them who</i>, &amp;c. See page 116.</p>

<p>2. An ellipsis, or omission of some words, is frequently admitted,
which must be supplied in the mind in order to parse grammatically;
as &quot;Wo is me;&quot; that is, <i>to</i> me; &quot;To sleep all night;&quot; i.e.
<i>through</i> all <i>the</i> night; &quot;He has gone a journey;&quot; i.e. <i>on</i> a
journey; &quot;They walked a league;&quot; i.e. <i>over a space called</i> a
league.</p>

<p>3. When the omission of words would obscure the sense, or weaken its
force, they must be expressed.</p>

<p>4. In the use of prepositions, and words that relate to each other,
we should pay particular regard to the meaning of the words or
sentences which they connect: all the parts of a sentence should
correspond to each other, and a regular and clear construction
throughout should be carefully preserved.</p></div>

<h4>FALSE SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>They are much greater gainers than me.</p>

<p>They know how to write as well as him; but he is a better grammarian
than them.</p>

<p>They were all well but him.</p>

<p>None were rewarded but him and me.</p>

<p>Jesus sought none but they who had gone astray.</p>

<a name="TENSES_ii"></a>
<h4>REMARKS ON THE TENSES.</h4>

<p>1. In the use of verbs, and other words and phrases which, <i>in point of
time</i>, relate to each other, a due regard to that relation should be
observed.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Instead of saying, &quot;The Lord <i>hath given</i>, and the Lord <i>hath taken</i>
away;&quot; we should say, &quot;The Lord <i>gave</i>, and the Lord <i>hath taken</i> away.&quot;
Instead of, &quot;I <i>remember</i> the family more than twenty years;&quot; it should
be, &quot;I <i>have remembered</i> the family more than twenty years.&quot;</p></div>

<p>2. The best rule that can be given for the management of the tenses, and
of words and phrases which, in point of time, relate to each other, is
this very general one; <i>Observe what the sense necessarily requires</i>.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>To say, &quot;I <i>have</i> visited Washington last summer; I <i>have seen</i> the work
more than a month ago,&quot; is not good <i>sense</i>. The constructions should
be, &quot;I <i>visited</i> Washington, &amp;c.; I <i>saw</i> the work, &amp;c.&quot; &quot;This mode of
expression <i>has been</i> formerly much admired:&quot;&mdash;&quot;<i>was</i> formerly much
admired.&quot; &quot;If I <i>had have</i> been there;&quot; &quot;If I <i>had have</i> seen him;&quot;
&quot;<i>Had</i> you <i>have</i> known him,&quot; are solecisms too gross to need
correction. We can say, I <i>have</i> been, I <i>had</i> been; but what sort of a
tense is, <i>had have been</i>? To place <i>had</i> before the <i>defective</i> verb
ought, is an error equally gross and illiterate:&mdash;&quot;<i>had</i> ought, <i>hadn't</i>
ought.&quot; This is as low a vulgarism as the use of <i>theirn</i>, <i>hern</i>, and
<i>hizzen</i>, <i>tother</i>, <i>furder</i>, <i>baynt</i>, <i>this ere</i>, I <i>seed</i> it, I
<i>tell'd</i> him.</p></div>

<p>3. When we refer to a past action or event, and no part of that time in
which it took place; remains, the <i>imperfect</i> tense should be used; but
if there is still remaining some portion of the time in which we declare
that the thing has been done, the <i>perfect</i> tense should be employed.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Thus, we say, &quot;Philosophers <i>made</i> great discoveries in the last
century;&quot; &quot;He <i>was</i> much afflicted last year;&quot; but when we refer to the
present century, year, week, day, &amp;c. we ought to use the <i>perfect</i>
tense; as, &quot;Philosophers <i>have made</i> great discoveries in the present
century;&quot; &quot;He <i>has been</i> much afflicted this year;&quot; &quot;I <i>have read</i> the
president's message this week;&quot; &quot;We <i>have heard</i> important news this
morning;&quot; because these events occurred in this century, this year, this
week, and to-day, and still there remains a part of this century, year,
week, and day, of which I speak.</p>

<p>In general, the perfect tense may be applied wherever the action is
connected with the present time, by the actual existence either of the
author of the work, though it may have been performed many centuries
ago; but if neither the author nor the work now remains, the perfect
tense ought not to be employed. Speaking of priests in general, we may
say, &quot;They <i>have</i>, in all ages, <i>claimed</i> great powers;&quot; because the
general order of the priesthood still exists; but we cannot properly
say, &quot;The Druid priests <i>have claimed</i> great powers;&quot; because that order
is now extinct. We ought, therefore, to say, &quot;The Druid priests
<i>claimed</i> great powers.&quot;</p>

<p>The following examples may serve still farther to illustrate the proper
use and application of the tenses. &quot;My brother has recently been to
Philadelphia.&quot; It should be, &quot;<i>was</i> recently at Philadelphia;&quot; because
the adverb <i>recently</i> refers to a time completely past, without any
allusion to the present time. &quot;Charles is grown considerably since I
have seen him the last time.&quot; Corrected, &quot;Charles <i>has</i> grown, since I
<i>saw</i> him,&quot; &amp;c. &quot;Payment was at length made, but no reason assigned for
its being so long postponed.&quot; Corrected, &quot;for its <i>having been</i> so long
postponed.&quot; &quot;They were arrived an hour before we reached the
city:&quot;&mdash;&quot;They <i>had</i> arrived.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The workmen will complete the building at the time I take possession of
it.&quot; It should be, &quot;will <i>have completed</i> the building,&quot; &amp;c. &quot;This
curious piece of workmanship was preserved, and shown to strangers for
more than fifty years past:&quot;&mdash;&quot;<i>has been</i> preserved, and <i>been</i> shown to
strangers,&quot; &amp;c. &quot;I had rather write than beg:&quot;&mdash;&quot;I <i>would</i> rather write
than beg.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty whereof Paul
was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands.&quot; It ought to be,
&quot;because he <i>would know</i>; or, <i>being willing to know,</i>&quot; &amp;c. &quot;The blind
man said, 'Lord, that I might receive my sight;'&quot; &quot;If by any means I
might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.&quot; In both these examples,
<i>may</i> would be preferable to <i>might</i>. &quot;I feared that I should have lost
the parcel, before I arrived:&quot;&mdash;&quot;that I should <i>lose</i>.&quot; &quot;It would have
afforded me no satisfaction, if I could perform it.&quot; It ought to be, &quot;if
I could <i>have performed</i> it;&quot; or, &quot;It <i>would afford</i> me no satisfaction,
if I <i>could perform</i> it.&quot; &quot;This dedication may serve for almost any book
that has, is, or shall be published:&quot;&mdash;&quot;that <i>has been</i>, or <i>will be
published</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<p>4. In order to employ the two tenses of the infinitive mood with
propriety, particular attention should be paid to the meaning of what we
express.</p>

<p>Verbs expressive of <i>hope</i>, <i>desire</i>, <i>intention</i>, or <i>command</i>, ought
to be followed by the PRESENT tense of the <i>Infinitive mood</i>.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>&quot;Last week I intended to <i>have written</i>,&quot; is improper. The intention of
writing was then <i>present</i> with me; and, therefore, the construction
should be, &quot;I intended <i>to write</i>.&quot; The following examples are also
inaccurate; &quot;I found him better than I expected <i>to have found</i> him;&quot;
&quot;My purpose was, after spending ten months more in commerce, <i>to have
withdrawn</i> my wealth to another country.&quot; They should be, &quot;expected <i>to
find</i> him;&quot; &quot;<i>to withdraw</i> my wealth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is a book which proves itself to be written by the person whose
name it bears.&quot; It ought to be &quot;which proves itself <i>to have been
written</i>,&quot; &amp;c. &quot;To see him would have afforded me pleasure all my life.&quot;
Corrected, &quot;<i>To have seen</i> him;&quot; or, &quot;<i>To see</i> him <i>would afford</i> me
pleasure,&quot; &amp;c. &quot;The arguments were sufficient to have satisfied all who
heard them:&quot;&mdash;&quot;were sufficient <i>to satisfy</i>.&quot; &quot;History painters would
have found it difficult to have invented such a species of
beings:&quot;&mdash;&quot;<i>to invent</i> such a species.&quot;</p></div>

<p>5. General and immutable truths ought to be expressed in the <i>present</i>
tense.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Instead of saying, &quot;He did not know that eight and twenty <i>were</i> equal
to twenty and eight;&quot; &quot;The preacher said very audibly, that whatever
<i>was</i> useful, <i>was</i> good;&quot; &quot;My opponent would not believe, that virtue
<i>was</i> always advantageous.;&quot; The constructions should be, &quot;<i>are</i> equal
to twenty;&quot; &quot;whatever <i>is</i> useful, <i>is</i> good;&quot; &quot;virtue <i>is</i> always
advantageous.&quot;</p></div>

<h3><b>CRITICAL NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS.</b></h3>

<div class='smalltext'><p>OBSERVATION 1. The following absurd phrases so common in the sacred desk
and elsewhere, should be carefully avoided by all who regard common
sense:&mdash;&quot;Sing the <i>two first</i> and <i>three last</i> verses.&quot; Just as if there
could be more than <i>one</i> first and <i>one</i> last. There may be a <i>first
two</i>, a <i>second two</i>, &amp;c.; a <i>first three</i>, a <i>second three</i>, a <i>last
three</i>. &quot;Within the <i>two last</i> centuries;&quot; &quot;The second syllable of the
<i>three first</i> words;&quot; &quot;The <i>three first</i> of these orthoepists have no
rule by which their pronunciation is regulated:&quot;&mdash;&quot;the <i>last two</i>
centuries;&quot; &quot;the <i>first three</i> words;&quot; &quot;the <i>first three</i> of these
orthoepists.&quot;</p>

<p>2. Adjectives should not be used to express the manner of action. &quot;The
higher the river, the <i>swifter</i> it flows;&quot; &quot;James learns <i>easier</i> than
Juliet; he sees <i>deeper</i> into the millstone than she:&quot;&mdash;&quot;the <i>more
swiftly</i> it flows;&quot; &quot;learns <i>more easily</i>; <i>farther</i> into the
millstone.&quot; &quot;He conducted the <i>boldest</i> of any:&quot;&mdash;&quot;the <i>most boldly</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>3. <i>More</i> requires <i>than</i> after it. The following sentences are
therefore improper: &quot;He was more beloved, but not so much admired, <i>as</i>
Cinthio;&quot; &quot;Richard is more active, but not so studious, <i>as</i> his
companion.&quot; The legitimate mode of supplying the ellipses in these
constructions, will show their gross impropriety: thus, &quot;He was more
beloved <i>as</i> Cinthio;&quot; &quot;Richard is more active <i>as</i> his companion,&quot; &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. Adverbs, as illustrated on page 85, are generally <i>substitutes</i> for
two or more words belonging to other parts of speech. &quot;Will you
accompany me to Europe next summer?&quot; <i>&quot;Yes.&quot;</i> &quot;Do you believe that the
voyage will restore your health?&quot; <i>&quot;No.&quot;</i> In these examples, the adverbs
<i>yes</i> and <i>no</i>, are substitutes for whole sentences, and, therefore, do
not qualify any words understood. <i>Yes</i>, in this instance, literally
means, <i>&quot;I will accompany you to Europe next summer;&quot;</i> and <i>no</i>, <i>&quot;I do
not believe that the voyage will restore my health.&quot;</i> Many other adverbs
are often employed in a similar manner.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Firstly,&quot;</i> is often improperly used instead of the adverb <i>first;</i> &quot;a
<i>good deal</i>,&quot; instead of, <i>much</i>, or, a <i>great deal</i>.</p>

<p>5. A nice distinction should be observed in the use of <i>such</i> and <i>so</i>.
The former may be employed in expressing <i>quality</i>; the latter, in
expressing a <i>degree</i> of the quality; as, &quot;<i>Such</i> a temper is seldom
found;&quot; &quot;<i>So</i> bad a temper is seldom found.&quot; In the following examples,
<i>so</i> should be used instead of <i>such:</i> &quot;He is <i>such</i> an extravagant
young man, that I cannot associate with him;&quot; &quot;I never before saw <i>such</i>
large trees.&quot;</p>

<p>The affected use of cardinal, instead of ordinal numbers, ought not to
be imitated. &quot;On page <i>forty-five;&quot;</i> &quot;Look at page
<i>nineteen</i>;&quot;&mdash;<i>forty-fifth, nineteenth</i>.</p>

<p>6. In the choice and application of prepositions, particular regard
should be paid to their meaning as established by the idiom of our
language and the best usage. &quot;In my proceedings, I have been actuated
from the conviction, that I was supporting a righteous cause;&quot; &quot;He
should have profited from those golden precepts;&quot; &quot;It is connected to
John with the conjunction <i>and</i>;&quot; &quot;Aware that there is, in the minds of
many, a strong predilection in favor of established usages;&quot; &quot;He was
made much on at Argos;&quot; &quot;They are resolved of going;&quot; &quot;The rain has been
falling of a long time;&quot; &quot;It is a work deserving of encouragement.&quot;
These examples may be corrected thus, &quot;actuated <i>by</i> the conviction;&quot;
&quot;<i>by</i> those golden precepts;&quot; &quot;<i>by</i> the conjunction and;&quot; &quot;predilection
<i>for</i>;&quot; &quot;much <i>of</i> at Argos;&quot; &quot;<i>on</i> going;&quot; &quot;falling a long time;&quot;
&quot;deserving encouragement.&quot;</p>

<p>7. The preposition <i>to</i> is used before nouns of place, where they follow
verbs or participles of motion; as, &quot;I went <i>to</i> Washington.&quot; But <i>at</i>
is employed after the verb <i>to be</i>; as, &quot;I have been <i>at</i> Washington;&quot;
&quot;He has been <i>to</i> New York, <i>to</i> home,&quot; &amp;c. are improper. The
preposition <i>in</i> is set before countries, cities, and large towns; &quot;He
lives <i>in</i> France, <i>in</i> London, <i>in</i> Philadelphia, <i>in</i> Rochester.&quot; But
before single houses, and cities and villages which are in distant
countries, <i>at</i> is commonly used; as, &quot;He lives <i>at</i> Park-place;&quot; &quot;She
resides <i>at</i> Vincennes.&quot; People in the northern states may say, &quot;They
live <i>in</i> New Orleans, or, <i>at</i> New Orleans.&quot;</p>

<p>8. Passive agents to verbs in the infinitive mood, should not be
employed as active agents. The following are solecisms: &quot;This house to
let;&quot; &quot;Horses and carriages to let;&quot; &quot;Congress has much business to
perform this session;&quot; because the agents, <i>house</i>, <i>horses</i> and
<i>carriages</i>, and <i>business</i>, which are really <i>passive</i>, are, according
to these constructions, rendered as active. The expressions should be,
&quot;This house to <i>be</i> let;&quot; &quot;Horses and carriages to <i>be</i> let;&quot; &quot;much
business to <i>be performed</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>9. AMBIGUITY.&mdash;&quot;Nothing is more to be desired than wisdom.&quot; Not
<i>literally</i> correct, for <i>wisdom</i> is certainly more to be desired than
<i>nothing</i>; but, as a figurative expression, it is well established and
unexceptionable.</p>

<p>&quot;A crow is a large black bird:&quot;&mdash;a large, <i>black&mdash;bird</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;I saw a horse&mdash;fly through the window:&quot;&mdash;I saw a <i>horsefly</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;I saw a ship gliding under full sail through a spy glass.&quot; I saw,
through a spy glass, a ship gliding under full sail.</p>

<p>&quot;One may see how the world goes with half an eye.&quot; One may see with half
an eye, how the world goes.</p>

<p>&quot;A great stone, that I happened to find, after a long search, by the sea
shore, served me for an anchor.&quot; This arrangement of the members and
circumstances of this sentence, confines the speaker's <i>search to the
sea shore;</i> whereas, he meant, &quot;A <i>large stone, which,</i> after a long
search, I happened <i>to find by the sea shore,</i> served me for an anchor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall only notice those called personal pronouns.&quot; I shall notice
<i>only</i> those called personal pronouns.</p>

<p>10. TAUTOLOGY.&mdash;Avoid words which add no thing to the sense; such as,
&quot;<i>Now</i> extant, <i>free</i> gratis, <i>slow</i> mope, <i>cold</i> snow, a <i>hot</i> sun, a
<i>flowing</i> stream, a <i>dull</i> blockhead, <i>wise</i> sages.&quot; &quot;I am just going to
go there;&quot; I am <i>about</i> to go.</p>

<p>11. ABSURDITIES AND IMPROPRIETIES.&mdash;&quot;I can learn him many things.&quot;</p>

<p>It ought to be, &quot;I can <i>teach</i> him.&quot; To <i>learn</i>, is to <i>acquire</i> or
<i>receive</i> information; to <i>teach</i>, means to <i>communicate</i> it.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think it is so.&quot; You <i>do think</i>, that it is <i>not</i> so.</p>

<p><i>Ever, always.</i> &quot;I have ever been of this mind.&quot; I have <i>always</i> been.
<i>Ever</i> and <i>always</i> are not synonymous. <i>Ever</i> refers to <i>one</i>
indefinite period of time; as, &quot;If he <i>ever</i> become rich:&quot; <i>always</i>
means <i>at all times</i>.</p>

<p><i>Excuse, pardon.</i> The former signifies to release from an obligation
which refers to the future; the latter, to forgive a neglect or crime
that is past. &quot;Excuse me for neglecting to call yesterday:&quot; <i>pardon</i> me.</p>

<p><i>Remember, recollect.</i> We <i>remember</i> a thing which we retain in our
mind; we <i>recollect</i> it, when, though having gone from the mind, we have
power to call it back.</p>

<p><i>Defect, deficiency.</i> A thing which is incomplete in any of its parts,
is <i>defective;</i> a total absence of the thing, is a <i>deficiency</i>.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE 1.&mdash;When the words <i>learned</i>, <i>blessed</i>, <i>loved,</i> &amp;c. are
used as participial adjectives, the termination <i>ed</i> should
generally be pronounced as a separate syllable; as, &quot;A <i>learn-ed</i>
man; The <i>bless-ed</i> Redeemer;&quot; but when they are employed as verbs,
the <i>ed</i> is contracted in pronunciation; as, &quot;He <i>learn'd</i> his
lesson; They are <i>lov'd;</i> I have <i>walk'd</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>2. The accent of the following words falls on those syllables
expressed in the <i>italic</i> characters: Eu ro <i>pe</i> an, hy me <i>ne</i> al,
Ce sa <i>re</i> a, co ad <i>ju</i> tor, ep i cu <i>re</i> an, <i>in</i> ter est ed, <i>in</i>
ter est ing, <i>rep</i> a ra ble, <i>rec</i> og nise, <i>leg</i> is la ture, <i>ob</i>
li ga to ry, in <i>com</i> pa ra ble, ir <i>rep</i> a ra ble, in <i>ex</i> o ra
ble. In a large class of words, the vowels <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>ai</i>,
should be pronounced like long <i>a</i> in <i>late</i>; such as, <i>fare</i>,
<i>rare</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>their</i>, <i>where</i>, <i>air</i>, <i>chair</i>, <i>compare</i>,
<i>declare</i>, &amp;c. In the words <i>person</i>, <i>perfect</i>, <i>mercy</i>,
<i>interpret</i>, <i>determine</i>, and the like, the vowel <i>e</i> before <i>r</i>, is
often <i>erroneously</i> sounded like short <i>u</i>. Its proper sound is that
of <i>e</i> in <i>met</i>, <i>pet</i>, <i>imperative</i>.</p>

<p>3. With respect to the pronunciation of the words <i>sky</i>, <i>kind</i>,
<i>guide</i>, &amp;c. it appears that a mistake extensively prevails. It is
believed that their common pronunciation by the vulgar, is the
<i>correct</i> one, and agreeable to the pronunciation intended by Mr.
John Walker. The proper diphthongal sounds in</p>
<pre>
  11    1      1
skei, kyind, gyide,
</pre>
<p>are adopted by the common mass, and
<i>perverted</i> by those who, in their unnatural and affected
pronunciation of these words, say,</p>
<pre>
  1 1   1 1      1 1
ske-i; ke-inde, ge-ide.
</pre>
<p>This latter mode of pronouncing them in two
syllables, is as incorrect and ridiculous as to pronounce the words
<i>boil</i>, <i>toil</i>, in two
syllables; thus,</p>
<pre>
 3 4    3 4
bo-il, to-il.
</pre>

<p>4. <i>My</i>, <i>wind</i>. When <i>my</i> is contrasted with <i>thy</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>your</i>, &amp;c, it is
pronounced,</p>
<pre>
 1
mi:
</pre>
<p> in all other situations, it is pronounced,</p>
<pre>
 1
me;
</pre>
<p>as, &quot;<i>My [me]</i>
son, give ear to <i>my [me]</i> counsel.&quot; When <i>wind</i> ends a line in poetry, and is
made to rhyme with <i>mind</i>, <i>bind</i>, <i>kind</i>, &amp;c. it is pronounced,</p>
<pre>
 1
wind;
</pre>
<p>but, in other situations, it is pronounced,</p>
<pre>
 4
wind.

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE, <i>Clever</i>, <i>pretty</i>, <i>ugly</i>, <i>curious</i>, <i>expect</i>, <i>guess</i>, and
<i>reckon</i>, though correct English words, have, among the common
people of New England and New York, a provincial application and
meaning. With them, a <i>clever</i> man, is one of a gentle and obliging
disposition; instead of, a man of distinguished talents and profound
acquirements. <i>Pretty</i> and <i>ugly</i>, they apply to the <i>disposition</i>
of a person, instead of, to his <i>external appearance</i>. In these
states, one will often hear, &quot;I <i>guess</i> it rains,&quot; when the speaker
<i>knows</i> this to be a fact, and, therefore, <i>guessing</i> is uncalled
for. &quot;I <i>expect</i> I can go;&quot; or, &quot;I <i>reckon</i> I can;&quot; instead of, &quot;I
<i>suppose</i> or <i>presume</i>.&quot; In New England, a clergyman is often called
a <i>minister</i>, in New York, a <i>priest</i>, and south of N.Y. a <i>parson</i>.

<a name='PROSODY'></a><h2>PROSODY.</h2>

<div class='bigtext'><p>PROSODY treats of the modulations of the voice according to the usages
of the language we speak, and the sentiments we wish to express: hence,
in its most extensive sense, it comprises all the laws of elocution.</p>

<p>Prosody is commonly divided into two parts: the first teaches the true
pronunciation of words, comprising <i>accent</i>, <i>quantity</i>, <i>emphasis</i>,
<i>pause</i>, and <i>tone</i>; and the second, the laws of <i>versification</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Accent</i>. Accent is the laying of a peculiar stress of the voice on a
particular letter or syllable in a word, that it may be better heard
than the rest, or distinguished from them; as, in the word <i>pres&uacute;me</i>,
the stress of the voice must be on the letter <i>u</i> and the second
syllable, <i>sume</i>, which syllable takes the accent.</p>

<p>Every word of more syllables than one, has one accented syllable. For
the sake of euphony or distinctness in a long word, we frequently give a
secondary accent to another syllable besides the one which takes the
principal accent; as, <i>'tes ti mo' ni'al</i>, <i>a ban'don 'ing.</i></p>

<p><i>Quantity</i>. The quantity of a syllable is that time which is occupied
in pronouncing it. It is considered as long or short.</p>

<p>A vowel or syllable is long, when the accent is on the vowel; which
causes it to be slowly joined in pronunciation with the following
letters; as, &quot;Fa&#772;ll, ba&#772;le, mo&#772;o&#772;d, ho&#772;u&#772;se, fe&#772;ature.&quot;</p>

<p>A syllable is short, when the accent is on the consonant; which causes
the vowel to be quickly joined to the succeeding letter; &quot;as, a&#774;nt,
bo&#774;nne&#774;t, hu&#774;nge&#774;r.&quot;</p>

<p>A long syllable generally requires double the time of a short one in
pronouncing it; thus, &quot;ma&#772;te&quot; and &quot;no&#772;te&quot; should be pronounced as
slowly again as &quot;ma&#774;t&quot; and &quot;no&#774;t.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Emphasis</i>. By emphasis is meant a stronger and fuller sound of the
voice, by which we distinguish some word or words on which we design to
lay particular stress, and to show how they affect the rest of the
sentence. Sometimes the emphatic words must be distinguished by a
particular tone of voice, as well as by a greater stress.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Emphasis will be more fully explained under the head of Elocution.</p></div>

<p><i>Pauses</i>. Pauses or rests, in speaking and reading, are a total
cessation of the voice during a perceptible, and, in many cases, a
measurable space of time.</p>

<p><i>Tones</i>. Tones are different both from emphasis and pauses; consisting
in the modulation of the voice, or the notes or variations of sound
which we employ in the expression of our sentiments.</p>

<p>Emphasis affects particular words and phrases; but tones affect
sentences, paragraphs, and sometimes a whole discourse.</p>



<h3><b><a name="PUNCTUATION"></a>PUNCTUATION.</b></h3>

<div class='bigtext'><p>PUNCTUATION is the art of dividing written composition into sentences or
parts of sentences, by points or stops, in order to mark the different
pauses which the sense and an accurate pronunciation require.</p></div>

<p>The <i>Comma</i> represents the shortest pause; the <i>Semicolon</i>, a pause
double that of the comma; the <i>Colon</i>, double that of the semicolon; and
the <i>Period</i>, double that of the colon.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Punctuation is a modern art. The ancients were entirely unacquainted
with the use of points; and wrote, not only without any distinction of
members and periods, but also without any distinction of words. This
custom continued till the year 360 before Christ. How the ancients read
their works, written in this manner, it is not easy to conceive. After
the practice of joining words together had ceased, notes of distinction
were placed at the end of every word. This practice continued a
considerable time.</p>

<p>As it appears that the present usage of points did not take place while
manuscripts and monumental inscriptions were the only known methods of
conveying knowledge, we must conclude, that it was introduced with the
art of printing. The introduction was, however, gradual: all the points
did not appear at once. The colon, semicolon, and note of admiration,
were produced some time after the others. The whole set, as they are now
used, became established, when learning and refinement had made
considerable progress.</p></div>

<p>As the rules of punctuation are founded altogether on the grammatical
construction of sentences, their application pre-supposes, on the part
of the student, a knowledge of Syntax. Although they admit of
exceptions, and require a continual exercise of judgment and literary
taste in applying them properly, they are of great utility, and justly
merit our particular attention.</p>

<p>The great importance of acquiring a thorough knowledge of punctuation,
and of attending strictly to the application of its rules, is
established by the single fact, that <i>the meaning of a sentence is often
totally perverted by the omission or misapplication of points</i>. To
illustrate the correctness of this remark, numerous example might be
selected. The following border on the ridiculous: &quot;Mr. Jared Hurton
having gone to sea his wife, desires the prayers of this church:&quot;
&quot;Tryon, who escaped from the jail on Friday last, is 22 years of age,
has sandy hair, light eyes, thin visage, with a short nose turned up
about six feet high, &amp;c.&quot; Corrected; &quot;Mr. Jared Hurton having gone to
sea, his wife desires the prayers of this church;&quot; &quot;thin visage, with a
short nose turned up, about six feet high, &amp;c.&quot;</p>

<p>Before one enters upon the study of punctuation, it is necessary for him
to understand what is meant by an <i>adjunct</i>, <i>a simple sentence</i>, and a
<i>compound sentence</i>.</p>

<p>An <i>adjunct</i> or <i>imperfect phrase</i> contains no assertion, or does not
amount to a proposition or sentence; as, &quot;Therefore;&quot; &quot;studious of
praise;&quot; &quot;in the pursuit of commerce.&quot;&mdash;For the definition of a
sentence, and a compound sentence, turn to page 119.</p>

<p>When two or more adjuncts are connected with the verb in the same
manner, and by the same preposition or conjunction, the sentence is
compound, and may be resolved into as many simple ones as there are
adjuncts; as, &quot;They have sacrificed their <i>health</i> and <i>fortune</i>, at the
<i>shrine</i> of vanity, <i>pride</i>, and <i>extravagance</i>.&quot; But when the adjuncts
are connected with the verb in a different manner, the sentence is
simple; as, &quot;Grass of an excellent <i>quality</i>, is produced in great
<i>abundance</i> in the northern regions of our country.&quot;</p>
<br />

<h4><b>COMMA.</b></h4>

<p>RULE 1. The members of a simple sentence should not, in general, be
separated by a comma; as, &quot;Every part of matter swarms with living
creatures.&quot;</p>
<a name="Exercises_in_Punctuation"></a>
<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises in Punctuation</i>.&mdash;Idleness is the great fomenter of all
corruptions in the human heart. The friend of order has made half his
way to virtue. All finery is a sign of littleness.</p></div>

<p>RULE 2. When a simple sentence is long, and the nominative is
accompanied with an inseparable adjunct of importance, it may admit a
comma immediately before the verb; as, &quot;The good taste <i>of the present
age</i>, has not allowed us to neglect the cultivation of the English
language;&quot; &quot;Too many <i>of the pretended friendships of youth</i>, are mere
combinations in pleasure.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises</i>.&mdash;The indulgence of a harsh disposition is the introduction
to future misery. To be totally indifferent to praise or censure is a
real defect in character. The intermixture of evil in human society
serves to exercise the suffering graces and virtues of the good.</p></div>

<p>RULE 3. When the connexion of the different parts of a simple sentence,
is interrupted by an adjunct of importance, the adjunct must be
distinguished by a comma before and after it; as, &quot;His work is, <i>in many
respects,</i> very imperfect. It is, <i>therefore,</i> not much approved.&quot; But
when these interruptions are slight and unimportant, it is better to
omit the comma; as, &quot;Flattery is <i>certainly</i> pernicious;&quot; &quot;There is
<i>surely</i> a pleasure in beneficence.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises</i>.&mdash;Charity like the sun brightens all its objects. Gentleness
is in truth the great avenue to mutual enjoyment. You too have your
failings. Humility and knowledge with poor apparel excel pride and
ignorance under costly attire. The best men often experience
disappointments. Advice should be seasonably administered. No assumed
behavior can always hide the real character.</p></div>

<p>RULE 4. The nominative case independent, and nouns in apposition when
accompanied with adjuncts, must be distinguished by commas; as, &quot;My
<i>son</i>, give me thy heart;&quot; &quot;Dear <i>Sir</i>, I write to express my gratitude
for your many kindnesses;&quot; &quot;I am obliged to you, my <i>friends</i>, for your
many favors;&quot; &quot;<i>Paul</i>, the <i>apostle</i>, of the Gentiles, was eminent for
his zeal and knowledge;&quot; &quot;The <i>butterfly</i>, <i>child</i> of the summer,
flutters in the sun.&quot;</p>

<p>But if <i>two</i> nouns in apposition are unattended with adjuncts, or if
they form only a proper name, they should not be separated; as, <i>&quot;Paul</i>
the <i>apostle</i>, suffered martyrdom;&quot; &quot;The <i>statesman Jefferson</i>, wrote
the declaration of Independence.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises</i>.&mdash;Lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all
generations. Continue my dear child to make virtue thy chief study.
Canst thou expect thou betrayer of innocence to escape the hand of
vengeance? Death the king of terrors chose a prime minister. Hope the
balm of life sooths us under every misfortune. Confucius the great
Chinese philosopher was eminently good as well as wise. The patriarch
Joseph is an illustrious example of true piety.</p></div>

<p>RULE 5. The nominative case absolute and the infinitive mood absolute
with their adjuncts, a participle with words depending on it, and,
generally, any imperfect phrase which may be resolved into a simple
sentence, must be separated from the rest of the sentence by commas; as,
&quot;<i>His father dying</i>, he succeeded to the estate;&quot; &quot;<i>To confess the
truth</i>, I was in fault;&quot; &quot;The king, <i>approving the plan</i>, put it in
execution;&quot; &quot;He, <i>having finished his academical course</i>, has returned
home, <i>to prosecute his professional studies</i>.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises</i>.&mdash;Peace of mind being secured we may smile at misfortune. To
enjoy present pleasure he sacrificed his future ease and reputation. His
talents formed for great enterprises could not fail of rendering him
conspicuous. The path of piety and virtue pursued with a firm and
constant spirit will assuredly lead to happiness. All mankind compose
one family assembled under the eye of one common Father.</p></div>

<p>RULE 6. A compound sentence must be resolved into simple ones by placing
commas between its members; as, &quot;The decay, the waste, and the
dissolution of a plant, may affect our spirits, and suggest a train of
serious reflections.&quot;</p>

<p>Three or more nouns, verbs, adjectives, participles, or adverbs,
connected by conjunctions, expressed or understood, must be separated by
commas; as, &quot;The husband, wife,<sup><a name='FN_anchor_11'></a><a href='#Footnote_11'>[11]</a></sup> and children,<sup><a name='FN_anchor_12'></a><a href='#Footnote_12'>[12]</a></sup> suffered extremely;&quot;
&quot;In a letter, we may advise, exhort, comfort, request, and discuss;&quot;
&quot;David was a brave, wise, and pious man;&quot; &quot;A man, fearing, serving, and
loving his Creator, lives for a noble purpose;&quot; &quot;Success generally
depends on acting prudently, steadily, and vigorously, in what we
undertake.&quot;</p>



<p>Two or more nouns, verbs, adjectives, participles, or adverbs, occurring
in the same construction, with their conjunctions understood, must be
separated by commas; as, &quot;Reason, virtue, answer one great aim;&quot; &quot;Virtue
supports in adversity, moderates in prosperity;&quot; &quot;Plain, honest truth,
needs no artificial covering;&quot; &quot;We are fearfully, wonderfully framed.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises.</i>&mdash;We have no reason to complain of the lot of man nor of the
mutability of the world. Sensuality contaminates the body depresses the
understanding deadens the moral feelings of the heart and degrades man
from his rank in creation.</p>

<p>Self-conceit presumption and obstinacy blast the prospects of many a
youth. He is alternately supported by his father his uncle and his elder
brother. The man of virtue and honor will be trusted relied upon and
esteemed. Conscious guilt renders one mean-spirited timorous and base.
An upright mind will never be at a loss to discern what is just and true
lovely honest and of good report. Habits of reading writing and thinking
are the indispensable qualifications of a good student. The great
business of life is to be employed in doing justly loving mercy and
talking humbly with our Creator. To live soberly righteously and piously
comprehends the whole of our duty.</p>

<p>In our health life possessions connexions pleasures there are causes of
decay imperceptibly working. Deliberate slowly execute promptly. An idle
trifling society is near akin to such as is corrupting. This unhappy
person had been seriously affectionately admonished but in vain.</p></div>

<p>RULE 7. Comparative sentences whose members are short, and sentences
connected with relative pronouns the meaning of whose antecedents is
restricted or limited to a particular sense, should not be separated by
a comma; as, &quot;Wisdom is better than riches;&quot; &quot;No preacher is so
successful as thee;&quot; &quot;He accepted <i>what</i> I had rejected;&quot; &quot;Self-denial
is the <i>sacrifice which</i> virtue must make;&quot; &quot;Subtract from many modern
poets <i>all that</i> may be found in Shakspeare, and trash will remain;&quot;
&quot;Give it to the <i>man whom</i> you most esteem.&quot; In this last example, the
assertion is not of &quot;man in general,&quot; but of &quot;the man whom you most
esteem.&quot;</p>

<p>But when the antecedent is used in a general sense, a comma is properly
inserted before the relative; as, &quot;<i>Man, who</i> is born of a woman, is of
few days and full of trouble;&quot; &quot;There is no <i>charm</i> in the female sex,
<i>which</i> can supply the place of virtue.&quot;</p>

<p>This rule is equally applicable to constructions in which the relative
is understood; as, &quot;Value duly the privileges you enjoy;&quot; that is,
&quot;privileges <i>which</i> you enjoy.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises.</i>&mdash;How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! The
friendships of the world can exist no longer than interest cements them.
Eat what is set before you. They who excite envy will easily incur
censure. A man who is of a detracting spirit will misconstrue the most
innocent words that can be put together. Many of the evils which
occasion our complaints of the world are wholly imaginary.</p>

<p>The gentle mind is like the smooth stream which reflects every object in
its just proportion and in its fairest colors. In that unaffected
civility which springs from a gentle mind there is an incomparable
charm. The Lord whom I serve is eternal. This is the man we saw
yesterday.</p></div>

<p>RULE 8. When two words of the same sort, are connected by a conjunction
expressed, they must not be separated; as, &quot;Libertines call religion,
bigotry <i>or</i> superstition;&quot; &quot;True worth is modest <i>and</i> retired;&quot; &quot;The
study of natural history, expands <i>and</i> elevates the mind;&quot; &quot;Some men
sin deliberately and presumptuously.&quot; When words are connected in pairs,
the pairs only should be separated; as, &quot;There is a natural difference
between merit <i>and</i> demerit, virtue <i>and</i> vice, wisdom <i>and</i> folly;&quot;
&quot;Whether we eat <i>or</i> drink, labor <i>or</i> sleep, we should be temperate.&quot;</p>

<p>But if the parts connected by a conjunction are not short, they may be
separated by a comma; as, &quot;Romances may be said to be miserable
rhapsodies, <i>or</i> dangerous incentives to evil.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises</i>.&mdash;Idleness brings forward and nourishes many bad passions.
True friendship will at all times avoid a rough or careless behavior.
Health and peace a moderate fortune and a few friends sum up all the
undoubted articles of temporal felicity. Truth is fair and artless
simple and sincere uniform and consistent. Intemperance destroys the
strength of our bodies and the vigor of our minds.</p></div>

<p>RULE 9. Where the verb of a simple member is understood, a comma may, in
some instances, be inserted; as, &quot;From law arises security; from
security, curiosity; from curiosity, knowledge.&quot; But in others, it is
better to omit the comma; &quot;No station is so high, no power so great, no
character so unblemished, as to exempt men from the attacks of
rashness, malice, and envy.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises</i>.&mdash;As a companion he was severe and satirical; as a friend
captious and dangerous. If the spring put forth no blossoms in summer
there will be no beauty and in autumn no fruit. So if youth be trifled
away without improvement manhood will be contemptible and old age
miserable.</p></div>

<p>RULE 10. When a simple member stands as the object of a preceding verb,
and its verb may be changed into the infinitive mood, the comma is
generally omitted; as, &quot;I suppose <i>he is at rest</i>;&quot; changed, &quot;I suppose
<i>him to be at rest</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>But when the verb <i>to be</i> is followed by a verb in the infinitive mood,
which, by transposition, may be made the nominative case to it, the verb
<i>to be</i> is generally separated from the infinitive by a comma; as, &quot;The
most obvious remedy is, <i>to withdraw from all associations with bad
men</i>;&quot; &quot;The first and most obvious remedy against the infection, is, to
withdraw from all associations with bad men.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises.</i>&mdash;They believed he was dead. He did not know that I was the
man. I knew she was still alive. The greatest misery is to be condemned
by our own hearts. The greatest misery that we can endure is to be
condemned by our own hearts.</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p>1. When a conjunction is separated by a phrase or member from the
member to which it belongs, such intervening phrase appears to
require a comma at each extremity; as, &quot;They set out early, <i>and</i>,
before the close of the day, arrived at the destined place.&quot; This
rule, however, is not generally followed by our best writers; as,
&quot;If thou seek the Lord, he will be found of thee; <i>but</i> if thou
forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever;&quot; &quot;<i>But</i> if the parts
connected are not short, a comma may be inserted.&quot;</p>

<p>2. Several verbs succeeding each other in the infinitive mood, and
having a common dependance, may be divided by commas; as, &quot;To
relieve the indigent, to comfort the afflicted, to protect the
innocent, to reward the deserving, are humane and noble
employments.&quot;</p>

<p>3. A remarkable expression, or a short observation, somewhat in the
form of a quotation, may be properly marked with a comma; as, &quot;It
hurts a man's pride to say, <i>I do not know</i>;&quot; &quot;Plutarch calls lying,
<i>the vice of slaves</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>4. When words are placed in opposition to each other, or with some
marked variety, they must be distinguished by a comma; as,</p>
</div>

<div class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Tho' <i>deep</i>, yet <i>clear</i>; tho' <i>gentle</i>, yet not <i>dull</i>;</span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Strong</i>, without <i>rage</i>; without <i>o'erflowing</i>, <i>full</i>.&quot;</span>
</div>

<div class='smalltext'>
<p>&quot;Good men, in this frail, imperfect state, are often found, not only
in union <i>with</i>, but in opposition <i>to</i>, the views and conduct of
each other.&quot;</p>

<p>Sometimes when the word with which the last preposition agrees, is
single, the comma may be omitted; as, &quot;Many states were in alliance
<i>with</i>, and under the protection <i>of</i> Rome.&quot;</p>

<p>The same rule and restrictions apply, when two or more nouns refer
to the same preposition; as, &quot;He was composed both under the
<i>threatening</i>, and at the <i>approach</i>, <i>of</i> a cruel and lingering
death;&quot; &quot;He was not only the <i>king</i>, but <i>the father of</i> his
people.&quot;</p>

<p>5. The words, &quot;as, thus, nay, so, hence, again, first, secondly,
formerly, now, lastly, once more, above all, on the contrary, in the
next place, in short,&quot; and all other words and phrases of a similar
kind, must generally be separated from the context by a comma; <i>as</i>,
&quot;Remember thy best friend; <i>formerly</i>, the supporter of thy infancy;
<i>now</i>, the guardian of thy youth;&quot; &quot;He feared want; <i>hence</i>, he
overvalued riches;&quot; &quot;<i>So</i>, if youth be trifled away,&quot; &amp;c. &quot;<i>Again</i>,
we must, have food and clothing;&quot; &quot;<i>Finally</i>, let us conclude.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>The foregoing rules and examples are sufficient, it is presumed, to
suggest to the learner, in all ordinary instances, the proper place for
inserting the comma; but in applying these rules, great regard must be
paid to the length and meaning of the clauses, and the proportion which
they bear to one another.</p>
<br />

<h5><b>SEMICOLON.</b></h5>

<p>The semicolon is used for dividing a compound sentence into two or more
parts, not so closely connected as those which are separated by a comma,
nor yet so little dependant on each other, as those which are
distinguished by a colon.</p>

<p>RULE 1. When the preceding member of the sentence does not of itself
give complete sense, but depends on the following clause, and sometimes
when the sense of that member would be complete without the concluding
one, the semicolon is used; as in the following examples: &quot;As the desire
of approbation, when it works according to reason, improves the amiable
part of our species; so, nothing is more destructive to them, when it is
governed by vanity and folly;&quot; &quot;The wise man is happy, when he gains his
own approbation; the fool, when he gains the applause of those around
him;&quot; &quot;Straws swim upon the surface; but pearls lie at the bottom.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises</i>.&mdash;The path of truth is a plain and safe path that of
falsehood a perplexing maze. Heaven is the region of gentleness and
friendship hell of fierceness and animosity. As there is a worldly
happiness which God perceives to be no other than disguised misery as
there are worldly honors which in his estimation are reproach so there
is a worldly wisdom which in his sight is foolishness.</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But all subsists by elemental strife</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And passions are the elements of life.</span><br />
</div>
<p>RULE 2. When an example is introduced to illustrate a rule or
proposition, the semicolon may be used before the conjunction <i>as;</i> as
in the following instance: Prepositions govern the objective case; as,
&quot;She gave the book <i>to</i> him.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE. In instances like the foregoing, many respectable punctuists
employ the colon, instead of the semicolon.</p></div>


<h5><b>COLON.</b></h5>

<p>The Colon is used to divide a sentence into two or more parts
less connected than those which are separated by a semicolon;
but not so independent as separate, distinct sentences.</p>

<p>RULE 1. When a member of a sentence is complete in itself, but followed
by some supplemental remark, or farther illustration of the subject, the
colon may be properly employed; as, &quot;Nature felt her inability to
extricate herself from the consequences of guilt: the gospel revealed
the plan of divine interposition and aid.&quot; &quot;Great works are performed,
not by strength, but by perseverance: yonder palace was raised by single
stones; yet you see its height and spaciousness.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Exercises.</i>&mdash;The three great enemies to tranquillity are vice
superstition and idleness vice which poisons and disturbs the mind with
bad passions superstition which fills it with imaginary terrors idleness
which loads it with tediousness and disgust.</p>

<p>When we look forward into the year which is beginning what do we behold
there? All my brethren is a blank to our view a dark unknown presents
itself.</p></div>

<p>RULE 2. When a semicolon has preceded, or more than one, and a still
greater pause is necessary, in order to mark the connecting or
concluding sentiment, the colon should be applied; as, &quot;A divine
legislator, uttering his voice from heaven; an almighty governor,
stretching forth his arm to punish or reward; informing us of perpetual
rest prepared for the righteous hereafter, and of indignation and wrath
awaiting the wicked: these are the considerations which overawe the
world, which support integrity, and check guilt.&quot;</p>
<br />

<h5><b>PERIOD.</b></h5>

<p>When a sentence is complete, and so independent as not to be connected
with the one which follows it, a period should be inserted at its close;
as, &quot;Fear God.&quot; &quot;Honor the patriot.&quot; &quot;Respect virtue.&quot;</p>

<p>In the use of many of the pauses, there is a diversity of practice among
our best writers and grammarians. Compound sentences connected by
conjunctions, are sometimes divided by the period; as, &quot;Recreations,
though they may be of an innocent kind, require steady government to
keep them within a due and limited province. <i>But</i> such as are of an
irregular and vicious nature, are not to be governed, but to be banished
from every well-regulated mind.&quot;</p>

<p>The period should follow every abbreviated word; as, &quot;A.D. N.B. U.S. Va.
Md. Viz. Col. Mr.&quot;</p>

<h5><b>DASH.</b></h5>

<p>The Dash, though often used improperly by hasty and incoherent writers,
may be introduced with propriety, where the sentence breaks off
abruptly; where a significant pause is required; or where there is an
unexpected turn in the sentiment; as, &quot;If thou art he, so much respected
once&mdash;but, oh! how fallen! how degraded!&quot; &quot;If acting conformably to the
will of our Creator;&mdash;if promoting the welfare of mankind around us;&mdash;if
securing our own happiness;&mdash;are objects of the highest moment: then we
are loudly called upon to cultivate and extend the great interests of
religion and virtue.&quot;</p>

<p>A dash following a stop, denotes that the pause is to be greater than if
the stop were alone; and when used by itself, requires a pause of such
length as the sense only can determine.</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Here lies the great&mdash;False marble, where?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Nothing but sordid dust lies here.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<h5><b>INTERROGATORY POINT.</b></h5>

<p>The note of interrogation is used at the end of an interrogative
sentence; as, &quot;Who adorned the heavens with such exquisite beauty?&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE. The interrogative point should not be employed in cases where
it is only said, that a question has been asked; as, &quot;The Cyprians
asked me, why I wept.&quot;</p></div>


<h5><b>EXCLAMATORY POINT.</b></h5>

<p>The note of exclamation is applied to expressions of sudden emotion,
surprise, joy, grief, &amp;c. and sometimes to invocations and addresses;
as, &quot;How much vanity in the pursuits of men!&quot; &quot;What is more amiable than
virtue!&quot; &quot;My friend! this conduct amazes me!&quot; &quot;Hear me, O Lord! for thy
loving kindness is great!&quot;</p>
<br />

<h5><b>PARENTHESIS.</b></h5>

<p>A parenthesis is a clause containing some useful remark, which may be
omitted without injuring the grammatical construction; as, &quot;To gain a
posthumous reputation, is to save a few letters (for what is a name
besides?) from oblivion.&quot;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Know then this truth, (enough for man to know,)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Virtue alone is happiness below.&quot;</span><br /></div>

<div class='smalltext'><p>NOTE. The parenthesis generally denotes a moderate depression of the
voice; and, as the parenthetical marks do not supply the place of a
point, the clause should be accompanied with every stop which the
sense would require, if the parenthetical characters were not used.
It ought to terminate with the same kind of point which the member
has that precedes it; as &quot;He loves nobly, (I speak of friendship,)
who is not jealous when, he has partners of love.&quot;</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Or why so long (in life if long can be)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Lent Heav'n a parent to the poor and me?&quot;</span><br />

<p>Parentheses, however, containing interrogations or exclamations, form an
exception to this rule; as, &quot;If I grant his request, (and who could
refuse it?) I shall secure his esteem and attachment.&quot;</p></div>

<h5><b>APOSTROPHE AND QUOTATION.</b></h5>

<p>The Apostrophe is used to abbreviate a word, and also to mark the
possessive case of a noun; as, &quot;<i>'tis</i>, for <i>it is</i>; <i>tho,'</i> for
<i>though</i>; <i>o'er</i>, for <i>over</i>;&quot; &quot;A <i>man's</i> poverty.&quot;</p>

<p>A Quotation marks a sentence taken in the author's own language; as,
&quot;The proper study of mankind is man.&quot;</p>

<p>When an author represents a person as speaking, the language of that
person should be designated by a quotation; as, At my coming in, he
said, &quot;You and the physician are come too late.&quot; A quotation contained
within another, should be distinguished by two <i>single</i> commas; as,
&quot;Always remember this ancient maxim 'Know thyself.'&quot;</p>
<br />

<h5><b>DIRECTIONS FOR USING CAPITAL LETTERS.</b></h5>

<p>It is proper to begin with a capital,</p>

<p>1. The first word of every sentence.</p>

<p>2. Proper names, the appellations of the Deity, &amp;c.; as, &quot;James,
Cincinnati, the Andes, Huron;&quot; &quot;God, Jehovah, the Almighty the Supreme
Being, Providence, the Holy Spirit.&quot;</p>

<p>3. Adjectives derived from proper names, the titles of books, nouns
which are used as the subject of discourse, the pronoun <i>I</i> and the
interjection <i>O</i>, and every line in poetry; as, &quot;American, Grecian,
English, French; Irving's Sketch Book, Percival's Poems; I write; Hear,
O earth!&quot;</p>

<h3><b><a name="VERSIFICATION"></a>VERSIFICATION.</b></h3>

<p>POETRY is the language of passion, or of enlivened imagination.</p>

<p>VERSIFICATION, in English, is the harmonious arrangement of a particular
number and variety of accented and unaccented syllables, according to
particular laws.</p>

<p>RHYME is the correspondence of the sound of the last syllable in one
line, to the sound of the last syllable in another; as,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;O'er the glad waters of the dark-blue <i>sea</i>,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Our thoughts as boundless and our souls as <i>free</i>.&quot;</span><br /></div>

<p>BLANK VERSE consists in poetical thoughts expressed in regular numbers,
but without the correspondence of sound at the end of the lines which
constitutes rhyme.</p>

<p>POETICAL FEET consist in a particular arrangement and connexion of a
number of accented and unaccented syllables.</p>

<p>They are called <i>feet</i>, because it is by their aid that the voice, as it
were, <i>steps</i> along through the verse in a measured pace.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>All poetical feet consist either of two, or of three syllables; and are
reducible to eight kinds; four of two syllables, and four of three, as
follows:</p></div>

<p>A Trochee has the first syllable accented, and the last unaccented; as,

<h4><b><a name="RHETORIC"></a>RHETORIC.</b></h4>

<p>GRAMMAR instructs us how to express our thoughts correctly.</p>

<p>RHETORIC teaches us to express them with force and elegance.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>The former is generally confined to the correct application of words in
constructing single sentences. The latter treats of the proper choice of
words, of the happiest method of constructing sentences, of their most
advantageous arrangement in forming a discourse, and of the various
kinds and qualities of composition. The principles of rhetoric are
principally based on those unfolded and illustrated in the science of
grammar. Hence, an acquaintance with the latter, and, indeed, with the
liberal arts, is a prerequisite to the study of rhetoric and
belles-lettres.</p></div>


<h4><b>COMPOSITION.</b></h4>

<p>It may be laid down as a maxim of eternal truth, that <i>good sense</i> is
the foundation of all good writing. One who understands a subject well,
will scarcely write ill upon it.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Rhetoric, or the art of persuasion, requires in a writer, the union of
good sense, and a lively and chaste imagination. It is, then, her
province to teach him to embellish his thoughts with elegant and
appropriate language, vivid imagery, and an agreeable variety of
expression. It ought to be his aim,</p>

<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>&quot;To mark the point where sense and dulness meet.&quot;</span><br /></div>

<h4><b>STYLE.&mdash;PERSPICUITY AND PRECISION.</b></h4>

<p>STYLE is the peculiar manner in which we express our conceptions by
means of language. It is a picture of the ideas which rise in our minds,
and of the order in which they are produced.</p>

<p>The qualities of a good style, may be ranked under two heads.
<i>perspicuity</i> and <i>ornament</i>.</p>

<p>PERSPICUITY, which is considered the fundamental quality of a good
style, claims attention, first, to single words and phrases; and,
secondly, to the construction of sentences. When considered with respect
to words and phrases, it requires these three qualities, <i>purity</i>,
<i>propriety,</i> and <i>precision.</i></p>

<p><i>Purity</i> of language consists in the use of such words and such
constructions as belong to the language which we speak, in opposition to
words and phrases belonging to other languages, or which are obsolete or
new-coined, or employed without proper authority.</p>

<p><i>Propriety</i> is the choice of those words which the best usage has
appropriated to the ideas which we intend to express by them. It implies
their correct and judicious application, in opposition to low
expressions, and to words and phrases which would be less significant of
the ideas which we wish to convey. It is the union of purity and
propriety, which renders style graceful and perspicuous.</p>

<p><i>Precision</i>, from <i>pr&aelig;cidere</i>, to cut off, signifies retrenching all
superfluities, and pruning the expression in such a manner as to exhibit
neither more nor less than an exact copy of the ideas intended to be
conveyed.</p>


<h4><b>STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES.</b></h4>

<p>A proper construction of sentences is of so great importance in every
species of composition, that we cannot be too strict or minute in our
attention to it.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Elegance of style requires us generally to <i>avoid</i>, many short or long
sentences in succession; a monotonous correspondence of one member to
another; and the commencing of a piece, section, or paragraph, with a
long sentence.</p></div>

<p>The qualities most essential to a perfect sentence, are <i>Unity</i>,
<i>Clearness</i>, <i>Strength</i>, and <i>Harmony</i>.</p>

<p>UNITY is an indispensable property of a correct sentence. A sentence
implies an arrangement of words in which only <i>one</i> proposition is
expressed. It may, indeed, consist of parts; but these parts ought to be
so closely bound together, as to make on the mind the impression, not of
many objects, but of only one. In order to preserve this unity, the
following rules may be useful.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>1. <i>In the course of the sentence, the scene should be changed as little
as possible.</i> In every sentence there is some leading or governing word,
which, if possible, ought to be continued so from the beginning to the
end of it. The following sentence is not constructed according to this
rule: &quot;After we came to anchor, they put me on shore, where I was
saluted by all my friends, who received me with the greatest kindness.&quot;
In this sentence, though the objects are sufficiently connected, yet, by
shifting so frequently the place and the person, the <i>vessel</i>, the
<i>shore</i>, <i>we</i>, <i>they</i>, <i>I</i> and <i>who</i>, they appear in so disunited a
view, that the mind is led to wander for the sense. The sentence is
restored to its proper unity by constructing it thus: &quot;Having come to
anchor, I was put on shore, where I was saluted by all my friends, who
received me with the greatest kindness.&quot;</p>

<p>2. <i>Never crowd into one sentence things which have so little connexion,
that they would bear to be divided into two or more sentences.</i> The
violation of this rule produces so unfavorable an effect, that it is
safer to err rather by too many short sentences, than by one that is
overloaded and confused.</p>

<p>3. <i>Avoid all unnecessary parentheses</i>.</p></div>

<p>CLEARNESS. <i>Ambiguity</i>, which is opposed to clearness, may arise from a
bad choice, or a bad arrangement of words.</p>

<p>A leading rule in the arrangement of sentences, is, that <i>those words or
members most nearly related, should be placed in the sentence as near to
each other as possible, so as thereby to make their mutual relation
clearly appear.</i> This rule ought to be observed,</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>1. <i>In the position of adverbs.</i> &quot;By greatness,&quot; says Mr. Addison, &quot;I do
not only mean the bulk of any single object, but the largeness of a
whole view.&quot; The improper situation of the adverb <i>only</i>, in this
sentence, renders it a limitation of the verb <i>mean</i>, whereas the author
intended to have it qualify the phrase, <i>a single object;</i> thus, &quot;By
greatness, I do not mean the bulk of any single object <i>only</i>, but the
largeness of a whole view.&quot;</p>

<p>2. <i>In the position of phrases and members.</i> &quot;Are these designs which
any man who is born a Briton, in any circumstances, in any situation,
ought to be ashamed or afraid to avow?&quot; Corrected: &quot;Are these designs
which any man who is born a Briton, ought to be ashamed or afraid, <i>in
any circumstances</i>, <i>in any situation</i>, to avow?&quot;</p>

<p>3. <i>In the position of pronouns.</i> The reference of a pronoun to its
noun, should always be <i>so clear that we cannot possibly mistake it:</i>
otherwise the noun ought to be repeated. &quot;It is folly to pretend to arm
ourselves against the accidents of life, by heaping up treasures, which
nothing can protect us against but the good providence of our Heavenly
Father.&quot; <i>Which</i>, in this sentence, grammatically refers to <i>treasures;</i>
and this would convert the whole period into nonsense. The sentence
should have been thus constructed, &quot;It is folly to pretend, by heaping
up treasures, to arm ourselves against the <i>accidents</i> of life, against
<i>which</i> nothing can protect us but the good providence of our Heavenly
Father.&quot;</p></div>

<p>STRENGTH. By the <i>strength</i> of a sentence is meant such an arrangement
of its several words and members, as exhibits the sense to the best
advantage, and gives every word and member its due weight and force.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>1. The first rule for promoting the strength of a sentence, is, to <i>take
from it all redundant words and members.</i> Whatever can be easily
supplied in the mind, should generally be omitted; thus, &quot;Content with
deserving a triumph, he refused the honor of it,&quot; is better than to say,
&quot;<i>Being</i> content with deserving a triumph.&quot; &amp;c. &quot;They returned back
again to the same city from whence they came forth.&quot; If we expunge from
this snort sentence <i>five</i> which are were expletives, it will be much
more neat and forcible thus, &quot;They returned to the city whence they
came.&quot; But we should be cautious of pruning so closely as to give a
hardness and dryness to the style. Some leaves must be left to shelter
and adorn the fruit.</p>

<p>2. <i>Particular attention to the use of copulatives, relatives, and all
the particles employed for transition and connexion, is required</i>. In
compositions of an elevated character, the <i>relative</i> should generally
be inserted. An injudicious repetition of <i>and</i> enfeebles style; but
when enumerating objects which we wish to have appear as distinct from
each other as possible, it may be repeated with peculiar advantage;
thus, &quot;Such a man may fall a victim to power; but truth, <i>and</i> reason,
<i>and</i> liberty, would fall with him.&quot;</p>

<p>3. <i>Dispose of the capital word or words in that part of the sentence in
which they will make the most striking impression</i>.</p>

<p>4. <i>Cause the members of a sentence to go on rising in their importance
one above another</i>. In a sentence of two members, the longer should
generally be the concluding one.</p>

<p>5. <i>Avoid concluding a sentence with an adverb, a preposition, or any
inconsiderable word, unless it be emphatical</i>.</p>

<p>6. <i>Where two things are compared or contrasted with each other, a
resemblance in the language and construction should be observed</i>.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<h4><b><a name="FIGURES_OF_SPEECH"></a>FIGURES OF SPEECH.</b></h4>

<p>Figures of Speech may be described as that language which is prompted
either by the imagination, or by the passions. They generally imply some
departure from simplicity of expression; and exhibit ideas in a manner
more vivid and impressive, than could be done by plain language. Figures
have been commonly divided into two great classes; Figures of <i>Words</i>,
and Figures of <i>Thought</i>.</p>

<p>Figures of Words are called <i>Tropes</i>, and consist in a word's being
employed to signify something that is different from its original
meaning; so that by altering the word, we destroy the figure.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>When we say of a person, that he has a fine <i>taste</i> in wines, the word
taste is used in its common, literal sense; but when we say, he has a
fine <i>taste</i> for painting, poetry, or music, we use the word
figuratively. &quot;A good man enjoys comfort in the midst of adversity,&quot; is
simple language; but when it is said, &quot;To the upright there ariseth
<i>light</i> in <i>darkness</i>,&quot; the same sentiment is expressed in a figurative
style, <i>light</i> is put in the place of <i>comfort</i>, and <i>darkness</i> is used
to suggest the idea of <i>adversity</i>.</p></div>

<p>The following are the most important figures:</p>

<p>1. A METAPHOR is founded on the resemblance which one object bears to
another; or, it is a comparison in an abridged form.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>When I say of some great minister, &quot;That he upholds the state like a
<i>pillar</i> which supports the weight of a whole edifice,&quot; I fairly make a
comparison; but when I say of such a minister, &quot;That he is the <i>pillar</i>
of the state,&quot; the word pillar becomes a metaphor. In the latter
construction, the comparison between the minister and a pillar, is made
in the mind; but it is expressed without any of the words that denote
comparison.</p>

<p>Metaphors abound in all writings. In the scriptures they may be found in
vast variety. Thus, our blessed Lord is called a vine, a lamb, a lion,
&amp;c.; and men, according to their different dispositions, are styled
wolves, sheep, dogs, serpents, vipers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Washington Irving, in speaking of the degraded state of the American
Aborigines who linger on the borders of the &quot;white settlements,&quot; employs
the following beautiful metaphor: &quot;The proud <i>pillar</i> of their
independence has been shaken down, and the whole moral <i>fabric</i> lies in
ruins.&quot;</p></div>

<p>2. AN ALLEGORY may be regarded as a metaphor continued; or it is several
metaphors so connected together in sense, as frequently to form a kind
of parable or fable. It differs from a single metaphor, in the same
manner that a cluster on the vine differs from a single grape.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>The following is a fine example of an allegory, taken from the 60th
psalm; wherein the people of Israel are represented under the image of a
vine. &quot;Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
heathen and planted it. Thou preparedst room before it; and didst cause
it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered
with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly
cedars. She sent out her boughs into the sea, and her branches into the
river.&quot;</p></div>

<p>3. A SIMILE or COMPARISON is when the resemblance between two objects,
whether real or imaginary, is expressed in form.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Thus, we use a simile, when we say, &quot;The actions of princes are like
those great rivers, the course of which every one beholds, but their
springs have been seen by few.&quot; &quot;As the mountains are round about
Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people.&quot; &quot;The music of Caryl
was like the memory of joys that are past, pleasant and mournful to the
soul.&quot; &quot;Our Indians are like those wild plants which thrive best in the
shade, but which wither when exposed to the influence of the sun.&quot;</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;The Assyrian came down, like the wolf on the fold,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And his cohorts were gleaming with purple and gold;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.&quot;</span><br /></div>

<p>4. A METONYMY is where the cause is put for the effect, or the effect
for the cause; the container for the thing contained; or the sign for
the thing signified.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>When we say, &quot;They read <i>Milton</i>,&quot; the cause is put for the effect,
meaning &quot;Milton's <i>works</i>.&quot; &quot;Gray hairs should be respected;&quot; here the
effect is put for the cause; meaning by &quot;gray hairs,&quot; <i>old age</i>, which
produces gray hairs. In the phrase, &quot;The kettle boils,&quot; the container is
substituted for the thing contained. &quot;He addressed the <i>chair</i>;&quot; that
is, the person in the chair.</p></div>

<p>5. A SYNECDOCHE OR COMPREHENSION. When the whole is put for a part, or a
part for the whole; a genus for a species, or a species for a genus; in
general, when any thing less, or any thing more, is put for the precise
object meant, the figure is called a Synecdoche.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Thus, &quot;A fleet of twenty <i>sail</i>, instead of, <i>ships</i>.&quot; &quot;The <i>horse</i> is a
noble animal;&quot; &quot;The <i>dog</i> is a faithful creature:&quot; here an individual is
put for the species. We sometimes use the &quot;head&quot; for the <i>person</i>, and
the &quot;waves&quot; for the <i>sea</i>. In like manner, an attribute may be pat for a
subject; as &quot;Youth&quot; for the <i>young</i>, the &quot;deep&quot; for the <i>sea</i>.</p></div>

<p>6. PERSONIFICATION or PROSOPOPOEIA is that figure by which we attribute
life and action to inanimate objects. When we say, &quot;The ground <i>thirsts</i>
for rain,&quot; or, &quot;the earth <i>smiles</i> with plenty;&quot; when we speak of
&quot;ambition's being <i>restless</i>,&quot; or, &quot;a disease's being <i>deceitful</i>;&quot; such
expressions show the facility, with which the mind can accommodate the
properties of living creatures to things that are inanimate.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>The following are fine examples of this figure:</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Cheer'd with the grateful smell, old <i>Ocean smiles</i>;&quot;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.&quot;</span><br /></div>

<p>7. AN APOSTROPHE is an address to some person, either absent or dead, as
if he were present and listening to us. The address is frequently made
to a personified object; as, &quot;Death is swallowed up in victory. O
<i>death!</i> where is thy sting? O <i>grave!</i> where is thy victory?&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>&quot;Weep on the rock of roaring winds, O <i>maid</i> of Inistore; bend thy
fair head over the waves, thou fairer than the ghost of the hills,
when it moves in a sun-beam at noon over the silence of Morveu.&quot;</p></div>

<p>8. ANTITHESIS. Comparison is founded on the resemblance, antithesis, on
the contrast or opposition, of two objects.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p><i>Example.</i> &quot;If you wish to enrich a person, study not to <i>increase</i> his
<i>stores</i>, but to <i>diminish</i> his <i>desires.&quot;</i></p></div>

<p>9. HYPERBOLE or EXAGGERATION consists in magnifying an object beyond its
natural bounds. &quot;As swift as the wind; as white as the snow; as slow as
a snail;&quot; and the like, are extravagant hyperboles.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>&quot;I saw their chief, tall as a rock of ice; his spear, the blasted
fir; his shield, the rising moon; he sat on the shore, like a cloud
of mist on the bills.&quot;</p></div>

<p>10. VISION is produced, when, in relating something that is past, we use
the present tense, and describe it as actually, passing before our eyes.</p>

<p>11. INTERROGATION. The literal use of an interrogation, is to ask a
question; but when men are strongly moved, whatever they would affirm or
deny with great earnestness, they naturally put in the form of a
question.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Thus Balaam expressed himself to Balak: &quot;The Lord is not man, that he
should lie, nor the son of man, that he should repeat. Hath he said it?
and shall he not do it? Hath he spoken it? and shall he not make it
good?&quot; &quot;Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice
like him?&quot;</p></div>

<p>12. EXCLAMATIONS are the effect of strong emotions, such a surprise,
admiration, joy, grief, and the like.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>&quot;O that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of way-faring men!&quot;
&quot;O that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be
at rest!&quot;</p></div>

<p>13. IRONY is expressing ourselves in a manner contrary to our thoughts;
not with a view to deceive, but to add force to our remarks. We can
reprove one for his negligence, by saying, &quot;You have taken great care,
indeed.&quot;</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>The prophet Elijah adopted this figure, when he challenged the priests
of Baal to prove the truth of their deity. &quot;He mocked them, and said.
Cry aloud for he is a god: either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or
he is on a journey, or, peradventure, he sleepeth, and must be waked.&quot;</p></div>

<p>14. AMPLIFICATION or CLIMAX consists in heightening all the
circumstances of an object or action, which we desire to place in a
strong light.</p>

<div class='smalltext'><p>Cicero gives a lively instance of this figure, when he says, &quot;It is a
crime to put a Roman citizen in bonds: it is the height of guilt to
scourge him; little less than parricide to put him to death: what name,
then, shall I give to the act of crucifying him?&quot;</p></div>

<h4>PUNCTUATION.</h4>

<h5>COMMA.</h5>

<h5><i>Corrections of the Exercises in Punctuation</i>.</h5>

<div class='smalltext'><p>RULE 1. Idleness is the great fomenter of all corruptions in the human
heart. The friend of order has made half his way to virtue. All finery
is a sign of littleness.</p>

<p>RULE 2. The indulgence of a harsh disposition, is the introduction to
future misery. To be totally indifferent to praise or censure, is a real
defect in character. The intermixture of evil in human society, serves
to exercise the suffering graces and virtues of the good.</p>

<p>RULE 3. Charity, like the sun, brightens all its objects. Gentleness is,
in truth, the great avenue to mutual enjoyment. You, too, have your
failings. Humility and knowledge, with poor apparel, excel pride and
ignorance, under costly attire. The best men often experience
disappointments. Advice should be seasonably administered. No assumed
behavior can always hide the real character.</p>

<p>RULE 4. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
Continue, my dear child, to make virtue thy chief study. Canst thou
expect, thou betrayer of innocence, to escape the hand of vengeance?
Death, the king of terrors, chose a prime minister. Hope, the balm of
life, sooths us under every misfortune. Confucius, the great Chinese
philosopher, was eminently good, as well as wise. The patriarch Joseph
is an illustrious example of true piety.</p>

<p>RULE 5. Peace of mind being secured, we may smile at misfortune. To
enjoy present pleasure, he sacrificed his future ease and reputation.
His talents, formed for great enterprises, could not fail of rendering
him conspicuous. The path of piety and virtue, pursued with a firm and
constant spirit, will assuredly lead to happiness. All mankind compose
one family, assembled under the eye of one common Father.</p></div>

<h5>KEY TO THE EXERCISES.</h5>

<div class='smalltext'><p>RULE 6. We have no reason to complain of the lot of man, nor of the
mutability of the world. Sensuality contaminates the body, depresses the
understanding, deadens the moral feelings of the heart, and degrades man
from his rank in creation.</p>

<p>Self-conceit, presumption, and obstinacy, blast the prospect of many a
youth. He is alternately supported by his father, his uncle, and his
elder brother. The man of virtue and honor, will be trusted, relied
upon, and esteemed. Conscious guilt renders one mean-spirited, timorous,
and base. An upright mind will never be at a loss to discern what is
just and true, lovely, honest, and of good report. Habits of reading,
writing, and thinking, are the indispensable qualifications of a good
student. The great business of life is, to be employed in doing justly,
loving mercy, and walking humbly with our God. To live soberly,
righteously, and piously, comprehends the whole of our duty.</p>

<p>In our health, life, possessions, connexions, pleasures, there are
causes of decay imperceptibly working. Deliberate slowly, execute
promptly. An idle, trifling society, is near akin to such as is
corrupting. This unhappy person had been seriously, affectionately
admonished, but in vain.</p>

<p>RULE 7. How much better it is to get wisdom than gold. The friendships
of the world can exist no longer than interest cements them. Eat what is
set before you. They who excite envy, will easily incur censure. A man
who is of a detracting spirit, will misconstrue the most innocent words
that can be put together. Many of the evils which occasion our
complaints of the world, are wholly imaginary.</p>

<p>The gentle mind is like the smooth stream, which reflects every object
in its just proportion, and in its fairest colors. In that unaffected
civility which springs from a gentle mind, there is an incomparable
charm. The Lord, whom I serve, is eternal. This, is the man we saw
yesterday.</p>

<p>RULE 8. Idleness brings forward and nourishes many bad passions. True
friendship will, at all times, avoid a rough or careless behavior.
Health and peace, a moderate fortune, and a few friends, sum up all the
undoubted articles of temporal felicity. Truth is fair and artless,
simple and sincere, uniform and consistent. Intemperance destroys the
strength of our bodies and the vigor of our minds.</p>

<p>RULE 9. As a companion, he was severe and satirical; as a friend,
captious and dangerous. If the spring put forth no blossoms, in summer
there will be no beauty, and in autumn, no fruit. So, if youth be
trifled away without improvement, manhood will be contemptible, and old
age, miserable.</p>

<p>RULE 10. They believed he was dead. He did not know that I was the man.
I knew she was still alive. The greatest misery is, to be condemned by
our own hearts. The greatest misery that we can endure, is, to be
condemned by our own hearts.</p></div>

<h5>SEMICOLON.</h5>

<div class='smalltext'><p>RULE 1. The path of truth is a plain and safe path; that of falsehood is
a perplexing maze. Heaven is the region of gentleness and friendship;
hell, of fierceness and animosity. As there is a worldly happiness,
which God perceives to be no other than disguised misery; as there are
worldly honors, which, in his estimation, are a reproach; so, there is a
worldly wisdom, which, in his sight, is foolishness.</p>

<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>But all subsists by elemental strife;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And passions are the elements of life.</span><br /></div>

<h5>COLON.</h5>

<div class='smalltext'><p>RULE 1. The three great enemies to tranquillity, are vice, superstition,
and idleness: vice, which poisons and disturbs the mind with bad
passions; superstition, which fills it with imaginary terrors; idleness,
which loads it with tediousness and disgust.</p></div>

<h3>FOOTNOTES.</h3>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_1'>[1]</a><a name='Footnote_1'></a> The word <i>thing</i>, from the Saxon verb <i>thingian</i>, to think, is
almost unlimited in its meaning. It may be applied to every animal
and creature in the universe. By the term creature, I mean that
which has been created; as, a dog, water, dirt. This word is also
frequently applied to actions; as, &quot;To get drunk is a beastly
<i>thing</i>.&quot; In this phrase, it signifies neither animal nor creature;
but it denotes merely an action; therefore this action is the thing.</p>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_2'>[2]</a><a name='Footnote_2'></a> Genii, imaginary spirits: geniuses, persons of great mental
abilities.</p>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_3'>[3]</a><a name='Footnote_3'></a> Indexes, when pointers or tables of contents are meant: indices,
when referring to algebraic quantities.</p>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_4'>[4]</a><a name='Footnote_4'></a> In the note next preceding, it is asserted, that my, thy, his,
her, our your, and their, are personal pronouns. What can more
clearly demonstrate the correctness of that assertion, than this
latter construction of the word theirs? All admit, that, in the
construction, &quot;The faith <i>of them</i>,&quot; the word <i>them</i>, is a personal
pronoun: and for this conclusive reason:&mdash;it represents a noun
understood. What, then, is <i>their</i>, in the phrase, &quot;their faith?&quot; Is
it not obvious, that, if <i>them</i> is a personal pronoun, <i>their</i> must
be, also? for the latter represents the same noun as the former.</p>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_5'>[5]</a><a name='Footnote_5'></a> The second person singular of <i>do</i>, when used as a principal
verb, is spelled with an <i>e</i>; thus, &quot;What thou <i>doest</i>, do quickly;&quot;
but when employed as an auxiliary, the <i>e</i> should be omitted; as,
&quot;<i>Dost</i> thou not <i>behold</i> a rock with its head of heath?&quot;</p>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_6'>[6]</a><a name='Footnote_6'></a> The men were drunk; i.e. inebriated. The toasts were drank.</p>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_7'>[7]</a><a name='Footnote_7'></a> Gotten is nearly obsolete. Its compound forgotten, is still in
good use.</p>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_8'>[8]</a><a name='Footnote_8'></a> Ridden is nearly obsolete.</p>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_9'>[9]</a><a name='Footnote_9'></a> Sang and sank should not be used in familiar style.</p>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_10'>[10]</a><a name='Footnote_10'></a> Spitten is nearly obsolete.</p>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_11'>[11]</a><a name='Footnote_11'></a> The correctness and importance of this rule appear to be so
obvious, as to render it not a little surprising, that any <i>writer</i>,
possessing the least degree of rhetorical taste, should reject it. I
am bold to affirm, that it is observed by every correct reader and
speaker; and yet, strange as it may seem, it is generally violated
by those printers who punctuate by the ear, and all others who are
influenced by their pernicious example; thus, &quot;The head, the heart
and the hands, should be constantly and actively employed in doing
good.&quot; Why do they not omit the comma where the conjunction is
understood? It would be doing no greater violence to the principles
of elocution; thus, &quot;The head the heart and the hands, should be,
&amp;c.&quot; or thus, &quot;The head the heart, and the hands, should be
employed,&quot; &amp;c. Who does not perceive that the latter pause, where
the conjunction is expressed, is as necessary as the former, where
the conjunction is understood? And, since this is the case, what
fair objection can be made to the following method of punctuation?
&quot;The head, the heart, and the hands, should be constantly and
actively employed in doing good;&quot; &quot;She is a woman, gentle, sensible,
well-educated, and religious.&quot;</p>

<p><a href='#FN_anchor_12'>[12]</a><a name='Footnote_12'></a> As a considerable pause in pronunciation is necessary between
the last noun and the verb, a comma should be inserted to denote it;
but as no pause is allowable between the last adjective and the
noun, or between the last adverb and the verb, the comma, in such
instances, is properly omitted; thus, &quot;David was a brave, wise, and
<i>pious</i> man.&quot;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
